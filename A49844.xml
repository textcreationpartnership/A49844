            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS upon a Short Treatiſe, Written by Mr. <hi>Timothy Manlove:</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul Aſſerted;</hi> and Printed in <hi>Octavo</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> 1697.</head>
            <p>AS an Introduction to theſe Obſervations, and in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Preface to them, the Obſerver thinks fit to ſet down and deliver a true Narrative of his Proceedings in the Enquiry after the Nature of the Humane Soul.</p>
            <p>Divers Years ago, the Obſerver fell into ſome doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of this ſort of Soul, and thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire after the true Conſtitution of it: And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſtrongly inclined to think it periſhable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable at the Death of the Perſon; he had ſeveral Diſputations with himſelf, and others, concerning the truth of that Surmiſe, all which concluded in the Opinion, or Judgment, That the extinguiſhment of it at Death, was more probable, than the ſeparate Subſiſtence of it after the Death of the Perſon.</p>
            <p>After having ſtood ſometime thus inclined, He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to deliver his Thoughts in Writing concerning the ſame, and in the ſpace of Six Months had Compoſed a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning it, compriſed in the ſpace or compaſs of Fifteen Sheets of ordinary Paper; which being finiſhed, he did willingly offer to be Peruſed by as many as uſually fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented his Company, and whom he conceiv'd capable of giving him Advice thereupon: But he found very few that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107186:2"/>were willing to take the trouble to examine his Diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and but one, a Neighbour-Miniſter, who did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Diſpute and Argue this Point againſt him. The performance of which Argument paſs'd in Writing betwixt them, and continu'd for the ſpace of about a Year.</p>
            <p>That Miniſter offer'd to the Conſideration of this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, all thoſe Places of Scripture mentioned in the Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and all thoſe Reaſons which in the ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe are compriſed, with ſome accumulate Additions of each kind. To all which, the Obſerver return'd his diſtinct Anſwers, which did not ſatisfy the Judgment of his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent; but ſeem'd ſufficient to the Judgment of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. Finally the Miniſter was rather tired than ſatisfy'd by this Encounter, and gave notice to the Obſerver, That Mr. <hi>Bently</hi> had lately Printed a Sermon concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which might tend to give him ſome Satisfaction or Light concerning it.</p>
            <p>Upon this Notice, the Obſerver, procur'd and Perus'd Mr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s Sermon, Intituled, <hi>Matter and Motion cannot Think.</hi> An Argument in the very Point, about which they were then Diſputing; and therefore the Obſerver forſook for a ſmall ſpace, thoſe Searches about which he was then employ'd, That he might Write ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon that Sermon, which he did, and Compris'd them in a Quarto-Pamphlet of Two Sheets and a half of Paper; and this Pamphlet is become the Subject of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s preſent Treatiſe, now to be Examined: The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Obſervations, was to excite Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to the communicating his fuller Thoughts to the World concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Subject. He promis'd in the beginning of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to prove what now Mr.<hi>M.</hi> has undertaken to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Humane Soul is in its Nature Immortal, and that it does ſo ſubſiſt by it ſelf, in a State of Separation from the Body.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107186:2"/>
            <p>This Aſſertion, the Obſerver believ'd was not well Proved by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in that Sermon. And therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by that Pamphlet, to Summon and Provoke the ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to a better and more full Performance of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Undertaking; expecting from Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, thereupon to gain ſome further knowledg and inſight into the Being and Nature of a Humane Soul.</p>
            <p>But Mr.<hi>B.</hi> perhaps taken up with Occaſions of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, or neglecting the Summons of ſo ſhort a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, and ſo unknown an Author; it ſeems forbore to proſecute any further the Performance of that Promiſe made in the beginning of his Sermon; becauſe we hear no further of any thing Publiſhed ſince by him upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>After the Printing of the afore-ſaid Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Sermon, the Obſerver return'd to the purſuit of his former Inquiries concerning the Soul: And ſet down in Writing the Heads of thoſe Objections which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid oppoſing Miniſter had made for the Refutation of his afore-mentioned Conceptions, annexing unto them his own Anſwer in that largeneſs wherein before they had been delivered.</p>
            <p>After which Performance, another Neighbour-Miniſter in a Viſit made to the Obſerver; gave him Notice, That he had lately met with a Book which gave him great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon this Point; by making a ſtrong Proof of the Soul's Immortality: And he was ſo kind as to bring the Book it ſelf with him, and leave it with the Obſerver to be Peruſed at his greater leiſure.</p>
            <p>The Title of this Book was, <hi>The Soul of Man,</hi> and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> late Miniſter of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> whom the Obſerver found by his Peruſal, to be a Man of very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Learning, and that he had diligently amaſs'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thoſe Arguments for the Soul's Immortality which the Obſerver had before met with in other Books, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107186:3"/>Places; and had drawn Inferences from them as Rationally as he conceiv'd the Argument would bear.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver, Therefore thought it not his part to let this Book paſs under his Peruſal, without ſuch Anſwers as he was able to make to every Argument and proving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of it; and this he pretends to have performed in his before-mentioned Treatiſe, of which he has made that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination a Part.</p>
            <p>After which Performance the Obſerver conſider'd, That what he had hitherto done upon this Subject amounted to no more than a Negative Proof, and that it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be demanded of him to give ſome Poſitive Proof concerning the Extinguiſhable Nature of his ſort of Soul: For which purpoſe, he has in the cloſe of his fore-cited Treatiſe Quoted divers Texts of Scripture, and ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſons, tending to prove the Veracity, or at leaſt the Probability of his preſent Conceptions. Which Three Parcels of his before-quoted Treatiſe, amounted in bulk to other Fifteen Sheets of Paper, in which he intended to finiſh his ſaid Treatiſe: But the ſame lying by him the ſpace of many Months, he light upon ſome Thoughts concerning the ſame Subject, which he thought fit to ſet down in Writing, and to add them to the afore-ſaid Treatiſe; which increas'd the bulk of it to the number of Twenty Sheets more, whence the fore-cited Treatiſe amounts to the bulk of Fifty Sheets of Paper. This Treatiſe lay by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver ſome Months after theſe Additions were finiſhed, and then he ſent it to <hi>London</hi> for a Publication of it by the Preſs; ſurmiſing ſuch a Publication might be obtained from Men of that Profeſſion, without the Author's charging himſelf with any further Coſt or Trouble about it. But therein he found himſelf very much miſtaken, for his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent inform'd him, That no Man would undertake the Charge and Hazard of ſuch a Publication of the Work of a Nameleſs Author, or that however, was like to paſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107186:3"/>under a Name unknown and very obſcure; but that ſuch a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication was like only to paſt at the ſole Expence and Charges of the Author, and could not be procured at leſs Charge than that of Fifty Pounds.</p>
            <p>This brought to the Obſerver's remembrance an old <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Story, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Philoſopher of that City much Enamoured upon a <hi>Courtiſan</hi> there, made her a Civil Viſit, and after ſome Diſcourſe, deſir'd to know the Price of her laſt Kindneſs? To which ſhe reply'd, <hi>That no Man ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Favour under the Price and Charges of One hundred Pounds.</hi> This Rate ſo ſurpriz'd the Philoſopher, that after he had ſat a while, muſing upon it; he roſe up, and giving the Lady thanks for her Civil Reception of him; he told her, <hi>That her Price was too high for him, and that he would not purchaſe Repentance at ſo dear a Rate.</hi> This the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apply'd to his own preſent Condition, he look'd upon Fifty Pounds as a very conſiderable Summ of Money, and that might do many better Services other ways. He pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with himſelf concerning the Fruits which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe through the expence of that Money, and found them moſt likely to be evil Surmiſes of Men poſſeſſed with the contrary Opinion, and their hard Speeches, and Reproaches, likely to enſue upon ſuch a Publication; and found his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations thereupon ſomewhat averſe from purchaſing thoſe and the like Perſecutions at ſo dear a Rate. He therefore gave order to his Correſpondent, that he ſhould procure a ſhallow Box ſuiting the Dimenſions of that Treatiſe, that he ſhould put his Writings into that Box, and Write upon it, <hi>The Treatiſe of ſuch a Man concerning the Humane Soul.</hi> Which Directions he has ſince been cerify'd, are carefully and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed. And in this Condition has his fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Treatiſe continu'd for the ſpace of divers Months Elapſed ſince that time, and might likely have continu'd for a much longer time, and even during the ſhort ſpace of the Obſerver's Life, if no new or accidental Occaſion, had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107186:4"/>call'd for the Publication of it. It is a received <hi>Axiom, That he who ordains the End, ordains the Means.</hi> As we Read, That God who by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> had fore-told the return of his People from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, by the Direction and Power of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> did in his appointed time, ſtir up the ſpirit of that Monarch to the fulfilling of that Prophecy: And did the like by <hi>Joſiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> while he was yet Young, to the fulfilling of what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told he ſhould do to the Altar and High-places erected at <hi>Bethel</hi> by <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> Alſo that upon the defection of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> from God's Service, <hi>he ſtirr'd up the ſpirit of</hi> Hadad <hi>the</hi> Edomite <hi>to raiſe war against him, and that God alſo then ſtirr'd up againſt him another Adverſary,</hi> Rezon <hi>the ſon of</hi> Eliadah <hi>to make war alſo againſt him,</hi> upon the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And this alſo the Obſerver applies to his preſent Condition, finding the Spirit of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſtirred up againſt him upon his former Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Sermon; which in the ſequel lays upon him a Provocation and a kind of neceſſity for the Publiſhing of his fore-mention'd Treatiſe; which very probably may prove ſuch ſtrong Arguments, as may break the bond of his former Frugality and links of Fearfulneſs, and bring to Publick View, that Treatiſe which he has before ſo often mentioned, and which it ſeems Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is ſo well prepared to Encounter, as that if in the ſame there be found any thing that may appear any way Infectious, or Poyſonous; there will be always an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote ready at Hand, from the Judicious Labours and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> who has promiſed to employ his uttermoſt Induſtry, Labours, and Learning, to that purpoſe. And herewith ſhall be concluded the Preface or Introduction, to thoſe Obſervations which the Writer intends to make on Mr. <hi>M</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s preſent Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The Frontiſpiece of this Treatiſe ſpeaks it Printed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1697, and yet a printed Copy of it came to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107186:4"/>Hand in the beginning of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1696. The Obſerver will make no further Inquiry what the Reaſon of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake may be; but go on to obſerve, That Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is uſhered in, by a Preface to which are ſubſcribed the Names of <hi>Jo. Howe,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Sylveſter:</hi> The reaſon of which Proceeding is not certainly known to the Obſerver. But becauſe he hears that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is Miniſter to a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Diſſenters, he is apt to imagine, that theſe two Perſons may be his Elders, and Aſſiſtants in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Congregation, and that their aſſent to his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe may be alledged in juſtification of this Undertaking. But howſoever that may fall out to be, the Obſerver at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Captus Oculis,</hi> having caus'd the Preface; and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to be diſtinctly Read before him, finds ſo much agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Matter and the Phraſes of theſe Two Pieces, as perſwades him confidently to believe, That they are both Woven in the ſame Loom, and that the ſame Head, Hand, and Spirit, runs through them both. The truth of which Conception he willingly leaves to be determined by the Judgment of others, who ſhall happen to Peruſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver does not find in this Preface a Deſign to Prove; but paſſes it rather upon the account of a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or Harangue, proceeding principally upon a grand Miſtake, <hi>viz. That he who denies the Immortality of the Soul, denies effectually the Being and Providence of God, and the full expectation of Recompences to be diſtributed after this Life, according to the Actions which dying Perſons have Practiſed through the Race of their Mortality.</hi> The certainty of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Laſt Judgment, is ſo fully, and clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, by a ſtrong Current and agreement in the Goſpel; that it ſeems as True, Evident, and well Proved, as the Truth of that Text is, which tells us, <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came to ſave ſinners:</hi> Altho' Mr. <hi>M.</hi> his Elders and Churches, and many others, take too little notice of them, and make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them accordingly.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch, as concerns the hard Speeches, paſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name and colour of thoſe Elders, the Obſerver is reſolutely bent to take no notice at all of them: For that when he began to Treat upon this Subject, he intended to follow our Lord's Direction; <hi>He ſat down and counted the coſt of ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking;</hi> and found the leaſt ſort of its Effects to be evil Surmiſes, hard Speeches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Men pre-poſſeſſed (who are likely to be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all thoſe who ſhould come firſt to the Peruſal of his Writings) againſt all whoſe Verbal Violence, he hop'd a reſolute Patience would be a very good Defence, and ſuch a Buckler as would ſhield him from all the fiery Darts of that kind; which he could reaſonably expect would be ſhot againſt him. And he farther conſider'd, That his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon this Point, was either an Error, or a Truth; and if it prove to be an Error: Admonitions, Reproofs and hard Speeches, were but due Recompentes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his Deſervings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>For what glory is it, if when ye are buffetted for your faults ye take it patiently.</hi> Duty binds Men to ſuffer patiently what they know they have deſerved, and there is no thanks, or commendations to be expected for their ſo doing: But if there happen to be much Truth in this Opinion, he may add to his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Hope, and ſome meaſure of Joyfulneſs: For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there adds, <hi>If ye do well and ſuffer for it patiently, this is acceptable with God,</hi> and Chap. 3.14. <hi>If ye ſuffer for the truth's ſake, happy are ye.</hi> James 1.2. <hi>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,</hi> viz. of this kind: And ſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, which was perhaps a greater degree of Perſecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when Men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you for the truth's ſake.</hi> But this meaſure of Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs which belongs to a Reviling for Truth's ſake, ſhall by the Obſerver be put off and deferred till the Point here in Queſtion ſhall be more fully Examined, and Diſcuſſed.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107186:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And therefore his Intention is to ſit down with the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Lord's Rule, <hi>In your patience poſſeſs ye your Souls;</hi> without making any other return to theſe Elders, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, than by repeating to them the <hi>Motto</hi> of the Garter, <hi>viz. HONI SO IT Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>I MAL Y PENSE,</hi> with Advice to remember our Lord's own Prediction, <hi>viz. With what meaſure you mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Altho' the Obſerver never intends to make them any Return of that nature.</p>
            <p>Hence we proceed to the Treatiſe it ſelf, which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has divided into Ten Chapters: Upon each of which the Obſerver intends to make ſome ſhort Obſervations, That it may appear he has Peruſed and gone through them all.</p>
            <p>Upon Chap. 1. p. 2. He obſerves, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the Powers Men may obtain, by getting ſuch an Aſcendant over their Proſelytes, and attaining ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem amongſt them, as that he may be able to Command their Underſtandings; becauſe, perhaps he may ſay true, <hi>That they themſelves never knew how to uſe them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> p. 8. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays many things concerning the Soul, which the Obſerver agrees with him in, <hi>Mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis, viz.</hi> by changing his Name of Soul into the Terms of the Rational Faculty, or Mind of Man, which has given <hi>vim Intelligendi &amp; Volendi cum Angelis,</hi> and yet be Acted by ſuch Materials as God has Appointed and Formed in Man for thoſe Purpoſes.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">P. </seg>9</label> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul of Man was Redeemed by the Sufferings of Chriſt.</hi> By which he ſeems plainly to intend, Such a Soul as is Intelligent in it ſelf, had once a Being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Body, is during Life conjoin'd to the Body, and after Death ſhall Live, Act, and Suffer in a State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body: And then the Obſerver utterly denies the truth of his Propoſition; and ſays, The true End of Chriſt's Coming into the World, was to Save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Perſons of them, both Souls and Bodies.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107186:6"/>
            <p>It is an uſual Practice of the Scripture, both in the Old and New Teſtament, to intend and deſign the Humane Perſon, by the Term and Name of Soul; and the ſame is alſo ſometimes done by the Name of Body, though nothing ſo often: And this is done by the common <hi>Synecdoche of Pars pro toto.</hi> For the Proof of which, two Inſtances of each kind are here intended to be produced,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. <hi>God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living Soul.</hi> The Obſerver, Aſſerts, That Soul in this Place, muſt intend the Perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if it had been ſaid, Man became a Living Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It has been commonly ſuppoſed to intend, That the Breath which God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils became a Living Soul: But this ſurmiſe is plainly Confuted by the Grammatical Conſtruction of it: For the Words which would have ſuited to that intent, ſhould have run thus: God breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and that, or it, <hi>viz,</hi> That Breath became a Living Soul. But <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo cautious in this Point, that he choſe to uſe ſomething of a Tautology in this Place, rather than that his Readers ſhould be ſo miſtaken in his meaning: He ſays, <hi>God made man, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of Life, and man became a living ſoul,</hi> or Perſon. He would not ſuffer them to think, That Breath became a Living Soul; but prevents that Conceit, by ſaying, That it was the Man that became the Living Soul, or Perſon. Whence this Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, concludes, That by the Soul in this Place, the Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> was ſomewhat clearly intended by this Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Law-giver of the <hi>Jews.</hi> His next Quotation for this uſe, ſhall be <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.10. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin. He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> The Obſerver ſays, That by Soul in this Place muſt needs be intended, the Perſon of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107186:6"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Body as well as Soul was made an Offering for Sin, that was Bound, Whipt, Buffetted, Spit upon, Crowned with Thorns, Loaded with his Croſs, Nailed to it, and Expir'd upon it, to obtain Redemption for Sinners, and the whole Race of Mankind. Whence he concludes, That by Soul in this Place, Is intended the whole Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well Body as Soul.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in two like Inſtances, for the Body. The 1ſt. He takes from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and offerings thou would'ſt not; but a Body haſt thou prepared me, ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will O God, ver.</hi> 10. By the which Will, we are Sanctified, through the offering of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> once for all. The Obſerver ſaies, By the Word and Term of Body in this Place, is intended the whole Perſon of Chriſt; whoſe <hi>Soul was ſorrowful even unto Death,</hi> and his Mind and Intellects ſo afflicted, as to wring Drops of Blond out of his Body, and reduce him to that bitter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> All which do ſufficiently Prove, That by the Word Body in this Text, the whole Perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and intended.</p>
            <p>His next Text is, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. where the Words are, <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</hi> He ſaies, That the Word Body in this Text, muſt needs intend the Perſon, or whole <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of Body and Soul; for that a Body without a Soul is Dead, and therefore cannot be Killed. By which Inſtances and Arguments, he thinks it well Prov'd: That though the Redemption be called of the Soul in divers Texts of the Scripture; yet all thoſe Places do intend, the Redemption of the Perſon, and that there never was any ſuch Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption intended, or performed as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has in this Page Aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the bare naked Soul ſeparated from the Body, asbefore has been Collected and Specified. Hence we proceed to his Second Chapter.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>II</label> p. 14. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>That a Soul made of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible periſhing Matter, is not fit to be called an Image of the Immortal God.</hi> But the Obſerver, ſaies, That Man made as he is, of corruptible periſhing Matter, was yet made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God, and is ſo accounted to continue at this Day; and for that Purpoſe He has join'd the Soul and Body together in a ſtrict Union, which cannot be Diſſolved. but by Death.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does in that Language. He ſaies of this Spirit, or Breath, <hi>That it was Created by God at</hi> Adam<hi>'s Creation.</hi> Which is more than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text does Warrant him to ſay: For the Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> ſpeaks of no other Creation there, than that of the Man; without ſaying, that God then Created either the Spirit, or the Breath; nor is there any other Creation there ſpoken of, ſave that of the Man. The reſt he paſſes as the Invention of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> who like ſome other Scholars, may deſire an Enterprize to be better than his Book.</p>
            <p>In this Chap. he has Collected many Texts of Scripture, which ſeem to maintain his Aſſertion, amongſt which there is nothing new to this Obſerver; ſave the great uſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rapture, which he ſets down p. 17. from whence he pretends to Prove, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> conceiv'd, his Soul was really diviſible from his Body; and capable of a Subſiſtence without it. As if he agreed with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107186:7"/>Dr. <hi>Moor</hi>'s Opinion, who Teaches, <hi>That the Humane Soul may, and ſometime does forſake its Body, and wander about in the Airy Region, and other Parts of the World, and make its return to the Body again at convenient times, or upon ſome ſudden Occaſions.</hi> But the Obſerver denies, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of any ſuch Opinion, and takes the ſenſe of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <hi>in the body, or out of the body,</hi> to be no other; but <hi>that he was wrapt up into the third Heaven, and there ſaw, and heard,</hi> as perfectly and diſtinctly as if he had done it with his Bodily Organs, and remember'd it as well: So that he could not certainly know, whether theſe Bodily Organs were imploy'd in that Rapture, or not; or whether that Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was only a Rapture or Extaſy of his Mind. We find a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Place to this in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Kings,</hi> where <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> the Prophet, ſaies to <hi>Ahab, I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon his Throne, and all the hoſt of Heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</hi> And there further relates, what he heard and ſaw in that Viſion. And it is thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, That he was not certainly knowing, whether it was made in his whole Perſon of Soul and Body, or whether it was only a Rapture and Extaſy of his Mind and Intellect. He thinks this Caſe very like that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and that the Words of his Rapture muſt prove exceeding weakly the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Subſiſtence of Souls after Death.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the Texts of Scripture he has Quoted, there is no more than one, which clearly maintains his Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. Cited by him p. 17. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> Theſe Words the Obſerver grants, do with clearneſs Prove, That Souls may have a ſeparate Subſiſtence after the Death of the Perſon. And therefore he will take upon him here, <hi>memoriter</hi> Collecting the Summ and Subſtance of that which he has ſaid more at large in his fore-mentioned Treatiſe upon this Subject. Where in oppoſition to the force of this Text, he Quotes <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. where the Words
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107186:8"/>of our Lord are, <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to caſt into hell.</hi> The Obſerver believes, That theſe two Texts of <hi>Matth.</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do intend to relate one ſame Fact and Doctrine of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And this Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> does not prove, That Souls have a ſeparate Subſiſtence after the Death of the Body, nor make any mention of the Soul at all. And that upon theſe two Texts, the Queſtion muſt needs ariſe, Which of them have truly related the Expreſſions which our Lord us'd at the delivering of this Doctrine? Upon which Queſtion, may be conſidered the Perſons and Qualities of theſe two Writers. <hi>St. Matthew</hi> was indeed, an Apoſtle; but his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Profeſſion and Practice was that of a <hi>Publican;</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice very hateful to thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; and ſo much, that no Perſon of Quality would undertake it, nor willingly Converſe with thoſe that Practis'd it. And hence the Obſerver Collects, He was not likely to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with any great ſtock of Humane Learning; but might eaſily be carried away by the common Opinion of that Time, believing the Humane Soul was Immortal and capable of Subſiſtence in a State of Separation from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that therefore he might, and probably did, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Part of our Saviour's Doctrine, in Words and Terms ſuiting his Conceptions of the Things. And that, on the contrary, St. <hi>Luke</hi> was a Knowing and Learned Phyſician, and wrote from the Mouth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the moſt Knowing and Learned amongſt all the Apoſtles, and who it ſeems was not poſſeſſed with the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality, or the ſeparate Subſiſtence of it after the Death of the Perſon; and therefore has delivered this Doctrine in Terms very different from thoſe of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and for the further ſtrengthening of this Apprehenſion, the Obſerver Quotes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.1. where the Words are, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſent two Diſciples, ſaying, go into the next village: and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107186:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>there ye ſhall find an aſſe tied, and a colt with her: looſe them, and bring them unto me: And they went accordingly, and found the aſſe and the colt, and brought them to Jeſus, and put on them their cloths, and ſat him thereon.</hi> This Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plainly Intends, That they brought two Beaſts to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſet him upon them both at one time; which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, and very unlikely ſort of Riding, incongruouſly, and ſomewhat untruly related: For that the other three Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts are clearly againſt him in it; for each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this Fact of our Lord, and mention but one Aſs in the Caſe, which truly was a Colt the Foal of an Aſs. And this Error of our Evangeliſt, ſeems not a bare, but a willing miſtake, for the obtaining of an End which he deſign'd in it. He Quotes in this Chapter, the Words of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, ſaying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek and ſitting upon an aſſe, and a colt the foal of an aſſe.</hi> His Quotation ſhews, that this Place of <hi>Zechary</hi> was known to him; and his own Relation of the Story, ſeems to Prove, That he intended to make our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Fact in this Place, agree punctually and <hi>in terminis,</hi> with thoſe Words of <hi>Zechary,</hi> which he had before Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And the Obſerver, conceives it ſomewhat likely, that he has erred in like manner, in delivering the Words our Saviour us'd in the Doctrine before-mentioned, where our Lord Teaches his Diſciples, to Fear God, rather than Men: And to give a further ſtrength to this Conception, he Quotes <hi>Matth,</hi> 28. which delivers many Circumſtances concerning our Lord's Reſurrection, <hi>viz. In the end of the ſabbath, as it began to dawn towards the firſt day of the week; came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to ſee the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. And behold, there was a great earth-quake; for the angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as ſnow. And for fear of him the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107186:9"/>And the angel anſwered and ſaid unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is riſen, as he ſaid, come ſee the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and tell his diſciples, that he is riſen from the dead; and behold, he goeth before you into Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, there ſhall ye ſee him, lo, I have told you. And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted quickly from the ſepulcher, with fear and great joy, and did run to bring his diſciples word. And as they went to tell his diſciples, behold, Jeſus met them, ſaying, All hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worſhipped him. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parando</hi> with this Relation, he Quotes, <hi>John</hi> 20. where the Words are: <hi>The firſt day of the week cometh Mary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gdalene early when it was yet dark, unto the ſepulcher, and ſeeth the ſtone taken away from the ſepulcher. Then ſhe ran to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and John, and ſaith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the ſepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</hi> And the two Apoſtles were ſo affected with this Relation, that they aroſe and ran to the Sepulcher to make themſelves Eye-Witneſſes of the Truth of this Fact: <hi>And coming to the ſepulcher, they went into it, and ſaw the linnen cloths,</hi> [uſed at his Burial; but the Body was clean gone.] <hi>Then the diſciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary ſtood without at the ſepulcher, weeping: and as ſhe wept, ſhe ſtooped down, and looked into the ſepulcher, and ſeeth two angels.</hi> who ask'd the cauſe of her VVeeping? <hi>She anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. Then turning her ſelf back, ſhe ſaw Jeſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was he. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou? ſhe ſuppoſing him to be the gardiner, ſaith unto him, Sir, if thou haſt born him hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men that well examine theſe two Relations, will find a great difference, and even an incompatibility between them: For that if <hi>Mary Magdelene</hi> had ſeen the Angel Diſcours'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107186:9"/>of in the Text of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and heard ſuch Tidings from him, and ſoon after had ſeen and ſpoken with our Lord himſelf; it oppoſes the common Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to conceive, ſhe ſhould ſo behave her ſelf upon this Occaſion, as the Relation of <hi>St. John</hi> has deſcribed to us. It ſeems ſomewhat clear to this Obſerver, That there is error in one of theſe two Relations; and he thinks, That the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by S. <hi>John</hi> is more credible, and that the error lies on the ſide of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Pars magni facti.</hi> He tells us what himſelf ſaw and knew; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is probable, That St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Diſcourſe was rather grounded upon Relations of ſome of the frighted Women, than proceeding from any thing of his own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Theſe two Inſtances Prove, That all the Relations we find in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> are not Infallible Truths; but ſome of them have need to be ſearched by Humane Sagacity, and the comparing of them with other Scriptures. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver inclines to take his Wording our Saviour's Doctrine againſt the over great fear of Men, to be like one of the two former Inſtances; and that it may ſtand in need to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with its parallel Text in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and to be Examined by it. But he is reſolved to leave this Point to the further Conſideration of Mr. <hi>M.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter alſo, he Quotes many other particular Texts of Scripture, which he thinks may Prove or Strengthen his Aſſertion: But the Obſerver finds not one among them, whoſe Proof is ſo full, or ſo clear, as that before Quoted out of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> All his other Texts, [except the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Dives,</hi> and that of the Thief upon the Croſs] ſeem to ariſe from Collections upon Inferences, and ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Expreſſions or Forms of Words in Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which do not Teach any thing concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State of Mankind; nor are ſpoken in thoſe Places, with intent to Teach concerning it. In which rank he places <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſhort Saying, <hi>The ſpirit returns to God who gave it.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107186:10"/>He does not wonder that Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Quotations ſeem to him, ſuch clear and evident Proofs as he pretends they do: For the reaſon thereof may be, and very likely is; becauſe he Reads and Conſiders them with the Mind already ſatisfied and aſſured, That the Soul is Immortal, and capable of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a State of Separation from the Body. But to a Man that is otherwiſe perſwaded; the much greater Part of his Quotations, will ſeem to be of very little force for the Proof of that Opinion, which he produces them for. The Obſerver can, and does inform him, That there is not one of them, which is not mentioned and diſcuſſed in that larger Treatiſe of the Obſerver's, which is before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. He has no mind in this Place <hi>Acta agere;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſes to refer Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Point, to that Treatiſe, which he has a ſtrong Inclination and Intent to Publiſh if God pleaſe to lengthen the feeble Thread of his Life, and give him Opportunity ſo to do.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Chapter aſcribes to his ſort of Soul, a great number and variety of Actions and Powers; but he does not ſo much as affirm, that any of them are Uſed or Acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the Bodily Organs. P. 25. he aſcribes Noble Faculties and Capacities to the Humane Soul, which he does not ſay ever appear'd to the World; ſaving in,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107186:10"/>and by its Conjunction with the Body. He ſaies, <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a Subſtance, muſt be known by the Powers Radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it.</hi> It ſeems he ſhould firſt have proved, or ſaid ſomething concerning the Subſtance of his Soul ſeparated from the Body, or that really there is ſuch a Subſtance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had aſcribed ſuch Excellencies to it. The Obſerver aſcribes all thoſe Excellencies to the Perſon; agreeing, that they do belong eſpecially to the Rational Faculty, or Mind of Man; which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> neither does, nor can maintain to have a ſeparate Subſiſtence after the Death of the Body. P. 26. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>It is manifeſt that the Nature of the Soul is very vigorous and ſprightly.</hi> He ſhould firſt have Proved, That a Soul conſidered ſeparate from the Body has a Nature, and diſcovered ſomething to us concerning it. But he did well to forbear the pretending to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, which the Obſerver believes is far beyond his Ability; but ſeeing he has not done it, the Obſerver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, That all his following Structure and Arguments proceed <hi>ex non conceſſis,</hi> and therefore make no good Proof of thoſe things which they have been alledged for: But that all thoſe things which he has aſcribed to the Soul, are really belonging to the Perſon; but are principally Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Rational Faculty, or Mind of Man. P. 27. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>When we are aſleep the Soul is often at work, in cauſing divers Dreams and Apprehenſions in the Night.</hi> And thus he aſcribes to the Soul, thoſe Operations which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to the Imaginations of Men; and which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was known to proceed from a Soul ſeparately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays further, <hi>That a Philoſopher thought, That Men's Dreaming when aſleep, was an intimation, that they ſhould Live when Dead.</hi> Which Thought is here paſt by the Obſerver, for a Philoſopher's Dream. P. 28. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>It is evident from his Collections here, That the nature of the Soul is very active.</hi> Whereas it does not yet appear, That the Soul has any Nature at all, if it ſhall be ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107186:11"/>conſidered from the Body. He ſaies further, <hi>That the vigour of the Mind in dying Perſons, appears ſometimes as ſtrong, or rather ſtronger, than it did in their better health.</hi> This Caſe the Obſerver thinks to be very rare, and that when it happens; it may reaſonably be aſcribed to ſuch Obſtructions as hinder the paſſage of thoſe Spirits, to and through the other Parts of the Body; which forces them to a cloſe and more full reſidence in, and about the Brain, than in their former State they us'd to have.</p>

P. 33. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> goes on here to magnify the Power of Humane Underſtanding from many Topicks, all which it ſeems conduce little to the Proof of this Point; for that in all this he never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, or affirms, That it Acts in any thing ſeparated from the Body, nor without the aſſiſtance of Bodily Organs; nor has any Man ever affirmed, nor does himſelf ſay, That the Humane Underſtanding ſurvives after the Death of the Perſon. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That Men cannot imagine, that a little Wheat-meal in two or three Days ſhould become capable of Mathematical Speculations.</hi> By which Words it appears clearly to the Underſtanding of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is very much miſtaken in the State and Caſe of this Argument: For the Obſerver has never ſaid, intended, or maintained, That Wheat-meal in Two or Three Days time, or at any time, is, or can be capable of underſtanding any thing at all, and it ſhews want of ordinary Apprehenſion in Mr. <hi>M.</hi> if he ever has, or does now conceive there was ſuch an Error in that Pamphlet which he undertakes to Anſwer. And therefore to clear up the Clouds of his Underſtanding in this Point: The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver will take pains to inform him, That the State of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107186:12"/>Caſe in this Queſtion, ſtands thus: He conceives and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That God Created the Body of Man, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a State of Perfection, ſo filled with Blond and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſet them into ſuch a State of Pullulation and Fermentation; that the Steems thence ariſing became fit and capable of being tinded and kindled by the fanning of a competent Breath, or Wind, which God caus'd to be Breathed into him, or according to the uſual Expreſſion, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life.</hi> This Breath tinded the freſh Steems of the Bloud and Humour, and kindled in <hi>Adam</hi> the Flame of Life: And that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and maintained in his Body, by the continual fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Breath of Life: And whenſoever that Breath is ſtopped, ſuch Flame muſt needs be extinguiſhed, and that Extinguiſhment is the very Death of the Perſon. Now tho' this gentle Flame (when the Body is well conditioned) is not uritory, but lambent; yet thereby, and by continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pure Bloud [which Daily ſupplies inflamed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for Actuating and Enlivening the ſeveral Parts of the Humane Body] upon that account, it ſuffers a conſiderable and Daily waſte and conſumption; for ſupply of which, a little Wheat-meal, or ſomething of that Nature, is often required, and Daily neceſſary. Our Daily Experience teaches us, that an active and lively Spirit may be Extracted from a Decoction of the Grains of Wheat, or Malt, or Fleſh, or any like ſorts of Nouriſhment, which by Comminution, is fitted for a more eaſie Concoction; after which, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reſult, is converted into Chyle; and that after is changed into Bloud, and is then ſent up to the Heart for a Purification; and thence departing, is fanned and made glowing by the Breath, and thoſe inflamed Particles paſs up through the Arteries into the Head and Brain; where meeting with Organs, prepared by God for that purpoſe; they cauſe and maintain ſuch Life, Power, and Activity as are ſuitable to thoſe Purpoſes for which God at the firſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107186:12"/>Created and Intended them. And by ſuch their Motion Activity and Energy, amongſt thoſe Capital Organs, are produced the Affectionate Senſitive, Perceptive, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, Eſtemative, Memorative, and Voluntary, Powers and Faculties of the Humane Head or Brain: And ſuch Stock of Spirits, as are found redundant in that Receptacle; deſcend from thence by the Nerves, and are by them Communicated to every Part and Member of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; to which they Communicate Life, Senſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but no underſtanding; becauſe there are no other Organs in the Body capacitated for that Performance, but only in the Head: Theſe Spirits and the Bloud of which they are formed, give Life, Strength and Motion, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part and Member of the Body, and therefore are called <hi>Vital Spirits;</hi> and yet theſe Spirits and the Bloud, out of which they are formed, have neither Senſe nor Life: For if a Vein be opened, and the freſh Bloud be ſuffer'd to ſpurt into the Fire; neither the Blood nor the Party will be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Pain by the ſo doing. Whence it appears, That theſe Bloud and Spirits cauſe that Senſe and Life in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which they themſelves have not, when ſeparated from it: And the like we ſay for the Inflamed Spirits, which aſcend up to the Head, and actuate the Organs there found: We ſay, that the <hi>Kephaline</hi> Organs deprived of ſuch Spirits are not intelligent, but a dead and ſtupid Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And that the Inflamed Spirits [though of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Activity] are neither Intellective, nor Senſitive; but that by acting the <hi>Kephaline</hi> Organs, they cauſe and produce Life, Senſe, Reaſon, and Activity in the Perſon, and thereby are performed ſuch Actions, and they produce ſuch effects as God intended, ſhould commonly be produced in the Perſons of Men. And this may be much illuſtrated and proved by an Argument; a Simily taken from the Structure of a Muſical Organ, the Fabrick of which conſiſts of a great number of Pipes well ordered and put together; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107186:13"/>of which Pipes is made to render a Singular and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sound of Treble, Mean, Tenor or Baſs: All which together well Conſtituted, and rightly Ordered by the Skill of the Artificer, imployed by an Active Hand; ſend forth ſuch Pleaſing and Harmonious Sounds as are both delightful and admirable to the Conſiderate Hearers; and yet all this Fabrick is but a dead and ſtupid Matter, and can do nothing of it ſelf without being ſupplied with a ſuitable Spirit from another Agent, the Bellows: But upon receiving from thence a ſuitable Breath or Spirit, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all its Powers and Capacities into Action; it makes the moſt excellent Harmony of any Inſtrument in the World; which is a Proceeding well known unto Men by daily Experience, and whereby it clearly appears, That the Fabrick of the Organ by it ſelf, or the Inſpiring Breath or Wind of the Bellows can make no Muſical Sound at all, but are each of them ſingly utterly incompetent for that purpoſe: The Wind proceeding from the Bellows, has no ſuch Sound in it ſelf; but by entring into the Pipes and acting them, receives ſuch a Modulation and Conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sounds, as the Artificer who made the Organ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhould be produced. And by this Simily it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, That neither the Wind by it ſelf, nor the Fabrick of the Organ by it ſelf, can perform any part of that Harmony, which by the Deſign of the Artificer was intended to be effected: So as the Wind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Bellows which has no Sound at all, does by its Paſſage into the Fabrick and Pipes thereof, and the acting of them; produce Sounds ſo melodious, as affect the conſiderate Hearers with Delight and Wonder. And now the Obſerver does apply this Simile to Teach and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the great Art and Skill ſhewn by the great Artificer of the World in contriving the Body, and eſpecially the Head of Man, in ſuch wonderful manner, as it might be continually Enlivened and Acted by ſuch a Material Spirit as he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107186:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>for it, to be continually ſupplied from the Bloud, which was alſo to be ſupplied by Daily Nouriſhment provided by God, and given to Man for that purpoſe, and was always to be fanned and thereby continued in a laſting Flame, ſo long as the Life of the Perſon ſhould endure. This Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude Proves, That a Material Spirit Acting in fit Organs, may produce ſuch Operations as the Spirit alone, or the Organs alone, have not the like Capacity to Perform, <hi>&amp; quae non proſunt ſingula, juncta juvant.</hi> The inflamed Spirits of Bloud have neither Affections, Senſes, nor Intellect, nor have the <hi>Kephaline</hi> Organs theſe Powers, of, or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the Spirit Acting thoſe Organs, as the Wind does in the Organ-Pipes; there is produced in both the Fabricks in <hi>Statu Compoſito;</hi> by thoſe Powers and Faculties ſo Acted, that which is in no meaſure is found in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Parts of ſuch a <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> conſidered in a State of Separation from one another. And upon this whole Diſcourſe, the Obſerver thinks it very clear, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> either did not underſtand the Intent of that Pamphlet he pretends to Anſwer, and the Forms of Expreſſions there uſed; or elſe he intended to Impoſe upon his unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Ridicule them by his witty Expreſſion here uſed: If the former, he ſeems thereby Convicted of great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Miſ-apprehenſion; if the latter, it ſeems he Diſingenuouſly intended to Amuſe his Readers and lead them into a falſe Apprehenſion concerning the Meaning and Expreſſions of that Pamphlet: But whether of theſe two Imputations he beſt deſerves, ſhall here be left to the Senſe and Judgment of his Readers.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> P. 36. Demands an Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Arguments; which the Obſerver having preſently Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, finds Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Arguments much Tranſcribed out of that Book and Place; and conceives, That his preſent Diſcourſe is a good Anſwer to them both: For that neither that Dr. nor Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Chapter does really touch, or come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107186:14"/>very near the true State of this Queſtion; which is not, What the Soul, or Mind of Man can do in a State of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with the Body: The Obſerver does eaſily agree, That thoſe things which here the Doctor and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in this Chapter may be done, and are done by the the Soul, or Mind of Man, in a State of Conjunction with the Bodily Organs: But he ſaies, That their manner of Proving the Point which they Maintain; ought to have been founded upon Arguments aſſerting and declaring, What the Soulever has done, or can do in a State of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Body; or as it may be conſidered in ſuch a Separate State abſtracted from the Body. The Obſerver has granted, That is <hi>Statu concreto,</hi> the Perſon can Act and Perform all thoſe Things, which they have aſcribed to the Soul of Man. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is Quoted in the former Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, where he concludes it improper to ſay, That the Soul is Wiſe, Learned, Sorrowful, or the like; becauſe properly ſpeaking, it is the Man, and not the ſingle Soul that is ſo. And Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his Treatiſe, repeats that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without offering to Anſwer, or Confute it. The Obſerver takes it for a very true Rule, very agreeable to the State and Nature of Mankind; and conceives, That the Queſtion now in Diſpute, is not, What Man's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can do, or what his Soul can do in <hi>Statu concreto</hi> with the Body? But whether, There be a Soul in Man which has a Capacity of Living and Acting in a State of Separation from the Body; and that thoſe who would Prove ſuch a Subſiſtence of the Soul, by Inſtances of what it can do; ought to produce Inſtances, which Prove the Power of its Living and Doing, in ſuch a State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or if they think themſelves able, to make a clear Notional Abſtraction of the Soul from the Body, which they can render Intelligible to other Men: Their proving Inſtances ought to be derived from ſuch a State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſuch an abſtracted Conſideration, as they can Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107186:14"/>offer to the Minds of others; and not from Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of what Man's Underſtanding can do, or his Soul can do in <hi>Statu concreto</hi> with the Body; for that theſe will be utterly unconcluding in the State and Management of this Queſtion. This Chapter of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s abounds with Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the latter ſort, and has not one amongſt them, that reaches to the Nature of the former; and therefore he thinks, There is no need of Diſputing any of them; but is ready to agree them and accept them all for true: But then he conceives them all to be <hi>parum ad rem,</hi> and not at all Proving that Part of the Queſtion which he pretends to maintain; and therefore howſoever true they may be, they are utterly unconcluding in this Argument: For which Reaſon, the Obſerver, who denies not the Truth of them, does yet paſs them for Taſteleſs and Inſipid, and thinks, they may very well be compared to the Herb <hi>John</hi> in the Pottage, which does neither good nor harm.</p>

Mr. <hi>M,</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That the ſelf-determining Power of the Will, its Acts and Objects, do argue, that the Soul is Immortal.</hi> The Obſerver Replies, That the Will has not ſuch a ſelf-determining Power: But ſaies, That in all its Inclinations and Operations deliberately Performed; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon, and follows the Directions and Concluſions of the Judgment, which it Obeys, Executes and follows with as great Promptitude and Natural Inclination, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs from higher Places, to lower Grounds: Not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by Power of the Judgment; but by a Free and Natural Propenſity inclining in to Execute thoſe Directions.

Seeing there are no Natural Appearances, that any other Faculty in Man's Mind can make a clear and true Diſtinction, or Difference in ſuch Actions or Caſes; but the Man's Eſtimative Power, or Judgment.

He thinks the Reaſon to be; becauſe Man's Reaſon and Judgment do conceive and believe, That God is the moſt Excellent Object of Man's Knowledge and Love; and that to Adore and Obey him, is likely to be the moſt beneficial to their Nature, by obtaining ſuch future Rewards, as Men believe, are promiſed and expected in a future State: All what he ſaies more of the Soul in this Place, the Obſerver applies to the Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man in <hi>Statu concreto.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107186:16"/>there, of which there may be a wonderful Variety and Diverſity, and then inquire within themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with others concerning the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of their Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what the Particular and Special Cauſes are, of their difference in Bulk, Height, Faſhion, Colour, Luſtre, Scent, and the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of all their Productions; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of which the Obſerver things to be Inſcrutable. In general, Men know there is Root, Stem, and Skin enough for theſe Productions; and that there is Spirit and Sap enough drawn from the Earth, for the Enlivening and Growth of them: But what the Modifications are of ſuch Matter or Spirit, or both of them together; and which produce among them ſo great a Variety or Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, the Obſerver conceives was never yet found out, nor undertaken by any Man, who has given an Account of his Succeſs to the World. And the like Queſtion the Obſerver propounds concerning the Trees of the Orchard. Men find amongſt them a ſufficient Matter, of Root, Bole, Bark, Branches, and Twigs: Alſo a plentiful Spirit, or Sap, aſcending moſtly between the Bark and the Tree, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening it and fructifying the uttermoſt Twigs of it; and cauſing the Production of Leaves, Bloſſoms and Fruit; but the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of this Performance he holds alſo to be Inſcrutable. And before Mr. <hi>M.</hi> demand an Account of the <hi>Quomodo</hi> the Spirits produce Intellingence in the Head of Man; let him firſt account to the Obſerver, or the World, for the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of an Oaken Leaf, by what means, and after what manner the Spirit and the Matter work together for the producing of it: And then conſider and account for the great variety of Wood, Leaves, Bloſſoms, Seed and Fruit; from what particular Compoſitions or Modifications of Matter or Spirit ſuch Things, Varieties and Differences do proceed. From theſe lower Inquiries, let him aſcend to the Conſideration of the Brutal Nature; and conſider by what ſort of Operations, or Contexture
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107186:17"/>of Spirit and Matter, the Powers and Actions of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are derived. Men know that there paſſes a Spirit in the Seed of thoſe Creatures into Receptacles fit for the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taion, Fomentation and Coagulation of them; and that from thoſe Principles the Bodies and Souls of Beaſts do proceed, and being afterwards brought to Perfection, then to the World, in their ſeveral Forms and different Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Body, they live, are nouriſhed and grow to their ſeveral Perfections; and that in their Natural State they enjoy, and uſe Strength and Activity, Local Motions, Affections, Deſires, Paſſions, Senſations, Perceptions, Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Memories. Men ſee that they have Matter ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe purpoſes, Fleſh, Bones, Nerves, Sinews, Muſcles, Arteries Veins, Fibres, and divers other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Parcels of their Material Bodies, and that theſe are enlivened and acted by the Spiritual, and yet Material Powers of Bloud and Breath. Out of the Maſs of Bloud purified, and heated in the Hearts of ſuch Creatures, there ariſe pure Particles of Bloud, fit and ready to be inflamed and which preſently are kindled, and tinded by fanning of the Breath in the ſame or like manner, as has been before deſcribed in relating the State and condition of Man in ſuch Caſes; and by the Matter before deſcribed, Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized; and the Material Spirits of the Bloud before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, acted together in a fit and ſuitable Contexture one with another; it is evident, all the Powers and Actions of the Brutes are thus derived: But concerning the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo</hi> from what ſort of Contexture, and manner of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; with what ſorts of Spirits and ſorts of Organs; and what Quantity and Purity are thereunto required: Alſo, the how after what manner <hi>(Applicando activa paſſivis)</hi> the Beſtial Powers and Actions proceed from them; the Obſerver eſteems to be the <hi>Arcanum Opificis,</hi> and this Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himſelf confeſſes to be ſo. How then can he without ſome meaſure of Effrontery, demand an Account
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107186:17"/>of the Obſerver concerning the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> or manner of proceeding in Efficiency of Perception, Intellect and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by Motion and Operation of the Spirits in the Heads of Men. <hi>Quae Supra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> It is not in the Power, or Intellect of Man to proceed ſo far in the Scrutinies of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but rather it ſeems Men muſt let that alone for ever; and leave that Myſtery undiſcovered and untouched, to reſt in the deep Fountain of God's Knowledge and Wiſdom. It ſeems alſo to be worthy of further Obſervation, That all Men who have received and believed the Opinion, that there are ſeparate Intelligent Spirits in the World, which Act and Perform divers things that exceed the ordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Humane Power; it is ordinary for ſuch Men to Apprehend (upon ſight of any ſtrange thing done, the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of which they cannot Inveſtigate, or find out the Reaſons of it) That thoſe Things, or Actions, are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of ſuch Intelligent Spirits. So <hi>Plato,</hi> Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of Men, to exceed the ordinary Capacity of Man's Underſtanding, fram'd this Imagination concerning them, <hi>That they did Pre-exiſt before their coming into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, even before the Exiſtence of our preſent World; That in a former World, they had diſpleaſed God by their Miſbehaviours; and that upon Creation of our preſent World, they were doomed and put into Bodies of Clay, as into Cages, or Priſons, and to paſs in way of Drudgery from one Body to another, for their Puniſhment and Purgation, until ſome of them might attain ſuch Degrees of Purity, as to ratiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the Lower Regions, and attain to the Places of their former Stations: And that other Ordinary Souls not ſo Purified, muſt ſtill continue in the Works of their Drudgery, and ſo paſs from Priſon to Priſon, till the time Appointed for the Duration of this World, be fully Paſſed, Finiſhed, and Ended. Ariſtotle</hi> conceiv'd, <hi>That each of the Planets was fixed in a ſeveral Orb, which had a continual Orbicular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And when he could not invent for them a Rational,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107186:18"/>or likely Cauſe of ſuch Motion, he ſatisfied himſelf with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, <hi>That thoſe Orbs were moved each by its particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;</hi> whom he was pleaſed to call by the Names of <hi>Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> We Read of ſome ſtrange Fabricks made by the Hands of Artificers, as <hi>Tripodes</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Vulcan</hi> made by <hi>Daedalus,</hi> which would remove of themſelves from one Place to another without any viſible aſſiſtance: And <hi>Architas</hi>'s Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, made at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> which would Fly high into the Air, and there make divers Doubles and Turns, and then return to the Place from which ſhe parted. The firſt of theſe paſs'd for a Miracle done by the Power of the God <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and the ſecond for the Act of a <hi>Daemon</hi> incloſed in the Fabrick of the Pigeon. In our Times, Namely, of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. liv'd <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> a great Artiſt of this kind, who at a Royal Reception of the Emperor into <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> caus'd an Eagle of Wood covered with Feathers, to meet the Emperor upon the Road, and return with him to the City; hovering over that Royal Head, or near it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he came to the Gate of it; which all the Spectators took for a Miracle: But when they underſtood it was an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Fabrick, they ſaid, no Man could effect ſuch a thing by Natural Means; but the Motion muſt needs be made by an incloſed <hi>Daemon,</hi> or Intelligent Spirit. From which Aſperſion of <hi>Necromancy</hi> the Artiſt could never reclaim the People; eſpecially, becauſe that ſome Years after, he made a Fly, whoſe Matter and Subſtance was all of Iron, which at a ſolemn Feaſt made by that Emperor, crept from the Sleeve of the Artiſt (who ſat at the lower end of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) and riſing thence ſhe Flew up along one ſide of the Table, before the Gueſts Faces; then croſs'd it at the end before the Emperor, and flew in like manner down the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Table to the lower end; where the Artiſt put forth his Hand and receiv'd her, and ſhe crept again under his Sleeve to her former Station. This made a great noiſe and cry in the World againſt the poor Artificer;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107186:18"/>whom the Emperor did with difficulty defend againſt the Violences and Exclamations of the People; though he ſhew'd and demonſtrated his Works and Devices made in the Bodies of theſe Machines: For the People (who could not underſtand, that ſuch things could poſſibly be done by Humane Art) ſaid, Thoſe things were but pretended to make a ſhew of Artificial Working; whereas the Truth could not be otherwiſe, than that ſuch Motion or Action muſt needs be Performed by the Force and Power of a ſeparate Intelligence: And the Caſe now Diſputed ſeems very like this: Our Opponents will not believe, That the Skill and Power of God, can Act the Fabrick of Man's Body by the Force and Energy of a Material Unintelligent Spirit; but that in the Acting of Humane Powers, he muſt needs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a ſeparate ſubſiſting and Intelligent Spirit. And this is the Caſe which is now Diſputed amongſt us. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver Maintains, That God can Animate and Act the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fabrick, and cauſe to be Performed all the Actions and Powers of Man, by the Force and Energy of a Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Unintelligent Spirit: And this was the Iſſue in the very Point Diſputed betwixt this Observer and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whoſe Sermon, p. 27. poſitively delivers in theſe Words, <hi>Omnipotence it ſelf cannot Create a Cogitative Body; not that there wants Power in God ſo to do; but that the reaſon of his not being able ſo to do, ariſes from the incapacity of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and becauſe the Ideas of Matter and Thought are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</hi> The Obſerver in his Pamphlet of Obſervations upon this Sermon, Flatly deny's the Truth of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and argues againſt it both by Reaſons and Inſtances in that Pamphlet: To which, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Treatiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to Anſwer, and yet he is pleaſed to ſlip over this Point, without taking any Notice, or making any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The reaſon of which his pretended Negligence, is clearly this, He durſt not undertake to maintain Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Aſſertion, and was very unwilling to own, that it was an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107186:19"/>Error; or that the Obſerver had the better of him in any thing. The Laws of True and Fair-dealing, requir'd of him to take Notice of this Queſtion, which was mainly Diſputed by the Obſerver againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in that ſhort Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet; and either to have Maintained Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Aſſertion, or confeſt, That it was an Error. And his avoiding ſo to do, teſtifies againſt his Ingenuity, and the faithfulneſs of his Dealing in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>It is true, That if upon Tryal, the Verdict ſhall pars up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Obſerver's ſide againſt Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Aſſertion; and, That God can Act the Perſon of Man in all his Natural Faculties and Powers, by the Activity and Energy of a Material Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent Spirit: There will ſtill remain another Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on behind, Whether God has done ſo, or has otherwiſe provided for it? But till the firſt Queſtion be Determined, there is neither need nor Reaſon to Diſpute upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; for if God cannot Act the Perſons of Men and all their Faculties, by ſuch a Material Spirit; then it is certain, He has not done ſo. And then there is no need at all for Diſputing the ſecond Queſtion. <hi>P.</hi> 40. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Diſcourſes upon that which he calls <hi>a Natural Conſcience;</hi> which the Obſerver thinks he is miſtaken in: For that Conſcience ſeems not Emanant from Nature, in ſuch manner as his Natural Affections and Inclinations are; not as his deſire of Food, or Venery, both comprehended under the Name of Luſt; nor as his Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Wrath, or Fear; nor as divers other Things are, which proceed from a Savage, as well as a Cultivated Nature. But to create a Conſcience in Man, there muſt ſome Law firſt be given him, and accepted by him; and by which he believes, his Actions acd Behaviour ought to be Governed. For that, <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> So that if Man has never Accepted, or Submitted to any Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thinks his Actions ought to be Ruled; he can never be capable of any Stings of Conſcience: For that thoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107186:19"/>Stings ariſe from the Perſwaſion Convincing him, That he has Offended againſt a Law which he ought in Duty to have Obeyed. For all Conſcience, whether he call it Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Acquired, muſt grow out of ſeveral Originals: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, Firſt, There muſt be a Law, next, There muſt be an Action, upon which two, the Memory muſt act and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Judgment, both the Law and the Action: The Judgment muſt compare and conſider them, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whether the Action be a Breach of the Law, or not: If it be not, there follows an Acquittance by the Judgment; but if a Breach be found, then it is conſidered, How far that Breach extends, Whether it be wide and large, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſmall. And the Stings and Laſhes of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are greater or leſſer, according to theſe Proportions: So that he thinks Conſcience to be no more than the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Man's Judgment, That he has Acted againſt his Rule: And whether that Rule be grounded upon Verity and Sound Truth, or upon Falſity and Error; yet after a a Man has received it for a Rule, and ſubmitted his Mind to the Obſervance of it; the Stings and Laſhes of the well-grounded Conſcience, and of the erroneous Conſcience are alike: But ſuch Miſtakes and Confuſions are not incident to Properties and Faculties Naturally Emanant from the Conſtitution of Nature it ſelf. He agrees, The Laſhes of Conſcience, or Self-condemnation, may be very great; but thinks they are rather derived from Inſtitution, than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He has ſpoken ſomewhat largely to this Point in his fore-mentioned Treatiſe, and therefore will Deſcant no more upon it in this Place; becauſe it will there be found, and becauſe it is a Subject, that neither can be, nor ought to be handled in few Words. <hi>P.</hi> 41. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Demands, <hi>Is it poſſible, that any Man ſhould believe, That the Notions of a Moral Good and Evil, the Remorſe of a bad Conſcience, and the Joys of a good one, ſhould proceed from nothing elſe, but the ſhufflings and cuttings of the ſpirituous Parts of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107186:20"/>Blood up and down the Ventricles of the Brain?</hi> To this the Obſerver Anſwers, The poſſibility of Acting ſuch Things as he ſpecifies, by the inflamed Particles called Spirits in the Brain; Depends upon the Queſtion before Anſwered, Whether God can Act the Humane Perſon and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by thoſe Material Spirits? For if ſo He can do; then theſe Actions and Faculties are not derived barely by the Motions and Actings of ſuch Spirits; but from the Wiſdom, Skill, and Power, of the Great Artificer. He that looks upon a Pair of Bellows and ſees and feels the Wind which proceeds from them, and knows no more of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of an Organ, than what he can conceive by the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and their Breath; could by no Arguments be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, That the Wind which proceeds from them, ſhould cauſe ſuch Excellent Harmony in that Inſtrument, as our Daily Experience Proves may be Performed. The Skill and Power of God has fitted and prepared ſuitable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in the Head for ſuch Performances, and ſuch as being acted, moved, and filled by theſe Spirits, can with, and by then Produce Senſe, Conception, Intellect, Memory, and all other Powers and Faculties whatſoever, which are by God intended to be Performed in the Brain and the Ventricles thereof.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Scbject, we find in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Eſſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Fol. 310. his Opinion touching this Matter, where he ſaies, <hi>We have the Ideas of Matter and Thinking, and poſſibly ſhall never be able to know, Whether any bare Material Being Things, or no; it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us by Contemplation, without Revelation, to diſcover, Whether Omnipotence has not given Power to ſome Syſtems of Matter (fitly diſpoſed) to Perceive and Think; or elſe, That he has joined and fixed to Matters ſo diſpoſed, a Thinking Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Subſtance.</hi> He thinks it poſſible for God to put Matter ſo together, as that it may be capable of Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Thought. Men cannot by Reaſon find out the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107186:20"/>Grounds of Senſation in Bodies, or Matter, but muſt Attribute that Power only to the good Pleaſure of God. We muſt allow, That God has annexed Effects to Motion, which we can no way conceive it able to produce. Whence the Obſerver inferrs, That Perception, Reaſon and Memory, may be produced in the Organs of an Humane Head, by the Activity and Motion of ſuch Animal Spirits; although we can no way conceive the manner how ſuch Actings and Motions are, or can be able to produce them. <hi>P.</hi> 43. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>The frequent Conflicts between Reaſon and the Senſitive Appetite fully prove, That there is a Power Superior to that of Matter and Motion, and that there is in Man a regent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Principle, which ſometimes chooſes the things moſt diſtaſteful to Senſe, and uſes the Body as its Inſtrument to ſerve its own Will and Pleaſure. And this Power.</hi> ſaies he, <hi>muſt needs be the Rational Intellectual Spirit in Man.</hi> To this the Obſerver Anſwers; By denying that there is ſuch a Regent Predominant Power in Man as he ſuppoſes: For that daily Experience ſhews us, that the Affections and Paſſions do far more often prevail over the Rational Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Deſires of Men, and hurry the rational Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers along with them to act all Uncleanneſs with Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; then that ſuch Rational Powers are able to reſtrain and govern thoſe Affections and Paſſions; and to keep or bring them within that Compaſs and Order which they may deſire to do. And the odds ſeems to be at leaſt Forty to One on the ſide of the Affections and Paſſions, againſt the Forces and Powers of the Rational Intellect: So as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver cannot diſcover that Monarchical and Regent Power in Man's Intellect, which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> pretends to be there: But rather conceives, That the Powers of the Intellect and Reaſon in Man, are Co-ordinate with the Powers of Senſe and Affection, and have not ſuch a Command over them as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſuppoſes; becauſe theſe Faculties are always in Contention one with another, from the Cradle to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107186:21"/>Grave; and are ſeldom if ever totally Subjugated one of them to another: Inſomuch that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> compares their Struglings to a Game at Ball, where ſometimes one ſide prevails, ſometimes the other; ſo as that no Man can gueſs with certainty whether Party ſhall have the total Victory or Conqueſt, till the laſt Stage of the Humane Life be run out and the laſt Scene thereof finiſhed. Whence the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver concludes, That the Powers of Senſe and Intellect in Man are Co-ordinate, and adds, that both of them are ready to ſubmit to the Vegetative Power, againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Deſires of them both, when the great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and preſſing Neceſſities of the <hi>Microcoſm</hi> do ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And from all theſe Premiſes he concludes, That there is no ſuch Monarchical or Regent Power in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm</hi> as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has ſurmiſed; nor ſuch an Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Intelligent Spirit as he has pretended: But that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Organs, and eſpecially thoſe of the Head and Brain are ſo fitly made, ſuited and ordered by their Great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and are ſo apt for the Execution of thoſe Offices for which they were Ordained; that all thoſe Effects may be perfectly produced amongſt them, by the Intervention and Energy of the Superfine, yet Material Unintelligent Spirits of the Blood: And conſequently Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Arguments on this Topick, are not ſufficient to maintain his part of the Queſtion. And for the account which he ſays is to be made for Mens misbehaving themſelves in this World; the Obſerver conceives, That it can be truly expected at the laſt Judgment only; as he thinks Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in his late Book well Proves. And he does not remember or know, there is any Scripture-Proof of an Intermediate Judgment, between Death and the laſt Judgment, but deſires Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Directions for finding out ſome Scripture-Proof of that Point, which is no other ways inveſtigable or ſubject to a Rational Enquiry.</p>

He ſaies, <hi>That Pherecydes liv'd in the time of</hi> Cyrus <hi>the firſt</hi> Perſian <hi>Monarch; in the beginning of whoſe Reign the</hi> Jews <hi>return'd from their</hi> Babyloniſh <hi>Captivity, and laid the Foundation of their ſecond Temple.</hi> And 'ſaies fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That from the beginning of</hi> Geneſis <hi>till that time, we meet with no mention of the Soul's Immortality, except</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's <hi>ſhort Expreſſion; The Spirit returns to God who gave it.</hi> The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> make no expreſs mention of the Soul's Immortality, or of any other Future State after Death; which ſeems to the Obſerver a ſtrong Argument, that the Apprehenſion of the Soul's Immortality, is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grafted in the Minds of Men, but acquired and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other Seeds, which have been ſown amongſt them; which from the time of <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> ſpread that Opinion far and Wide over the Face of the whole Earth, and was greedily received and cultivated amongſt Men, and was communicated alſo to the Weaker Sex: So that Mothers and Nurſes were able to Sow it in the tender Minds of Children from their firſt Infancies, which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Tutors increas'd amongſt their Children and Diſciples, till it became generally accepted amongſt Men, and ſpread it Pelf amongſt all the World; Error as it was.</p>
            <p>In like manner as the Opinion of the Sun's Courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth in Twenty four Hours was received. Alſo as the Doctrine and Practice of Idolatry, poſſeſs'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the World, from the Time of the Flood untill the preſent Time. Of the Ancient Practice thereof we read much, and of our preſent Time, we have certain evidence, that it continues to be practiſed in <hi>India, Tartary, China,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107186:22"/>Japan, Africa,</hi> and amongſt the Gentiles of <hi>America,</hi> and amongſt the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Romiſh-Chriſtian</hi> Churches. So as by the Argument of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> It ſeems Men may as well conclude, That the Doctrine and Practice of Idolatry is Natural to Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is not the far ſpreading and long duration of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that can certainly Prove it to be Natural. But that which is truly Natural muſt have been from the Beginning, and have a continuance amongſt Men, ſo long as their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State ſhall endure; as an Incident to the whole Kind, and Race, who attain to the common perfections of Parts and of Degrees, as Effluxes of their Natural Conſtitutions. Of which ſort he does not conceive that any Opinion can be: For Opinions in their Natures are mutable, <hi>&amp; Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia non mutantur;</hi> and therefore God did not leave Man to learn the Knowledge of himſelf from any Natural Power, Inſtinct, or Inclination. But himſelf Inſtructed their Firſt Father and divers others of his Progeny, down to the Time of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, in the Knowledge and Fear of God. And when theſe Rules became Obliterated in the general Race of Men; he choſe out <hi>Abraham</hi> from amongſt them, and communicated to him a greater meaſure of Knowledge concerning God, and his Will, than any Man ſince the time of <hi>Noah</hi> had received before him. After which, he Reveal'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> many more Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, his Attributes and his Will. Afterwards he declar'd the ſame to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and after to all the Degrees, of Prophets down to <hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Malachy:</hi> And theſe Prophets have delivered many Revelations in their Books. Amongſt all which, there is not one Sentence, or Saying, That the Soul of Man is Immortal; except what may be Collected by Conſtruction from the Fore-quoted Sentence of <hi>Solomon,</hi> tranſiently delivered by him.</p>
            <p>Whence it appears, That this Opinion was not from the Beginning, and therefore not Natural, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſuppoſes.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107186:22"/>And if from hence we paſs to the New Teſtament, we find not in it any Text; which ſaies, The Soul of Man is Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.

But concerning this Text, we muſt refer to what has been before ſpoken with intent to diminiſh the Credit and Power of it. The Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> agrees ſomething with this Opinion; but we take it not for Proof; becauſe it was but a Parable, ſpoken (as we conceive) to a quite other Intent; and without Deſign to Teach any Thing concerning the State of Man after Death. Neither of theſe two Texts do Aſſert poſitively the Soul's Immortality. And there is not another Text in the New Teſtament which ſpeaks with any manner of clearneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.

            <p>When our Lord Diſcourſes with <hi>Martha</hi> concerning her Dead Brother; neither he nor ſhe, takes notice or makes mention of his Soul; but paſs that Particular as a Thing not known to them; or deſerving, their particular Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet they both Diſcourſe of his Future State. Our Lord ſaies, <hi>Thy brother ſhall riſe again.</hi> She Replies, <hi>I know he ſhall riſe again at the Reſurrection of the laſt day.</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver pretends (by as good a Right as his Oppoſer does) to Collect and Infer from this Diſcourſe, That neither of theſe Parties knew the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be Immortal; for that ſuch Knowledge would have occaſioned them to mention ſomething concerning it in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And further, the Obſerver ſaies, That in all the reſt of the New Teſtament there is no clear Mention or Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made concerning this ſuppoſed Truth; nor is it any where ſo much as ſaid, The Soul of Man is Immortal. How
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107186:23"/>then can this Opinion paſs for Natural amongſt Men of common Underſtanding and Reading, when it is ſo little mentioned, and with ſo little certainty, and ſo great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, throughout both the Books of the Old and New Teſtament. And upon this Argument, it ſhall be left to the Reader to conceive what he thinks fit concerning the Naturalneſs of this Opinion. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That God Rules the World, by the Force and Virtue of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul's Immortality.</hi> To this the Obſerver Anſwers, That if his Mind were ſet upon making ſharp Returns, here were a fair Field, and a fit Occaſion for putting that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in Execution: But he will here content himſelf with the abhorring the groſneſs of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Opinion in it, and to Atteſt againſt him, That God makes no uſe at all of this Opinion in his Government of the World; but grounds his Government of it upon his own Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Power; without having any regard to the Opinions of Men, whether they be True, or Falſe. Mr, <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>God need not, will not Rule the World in a way of Deceit.</hi> The Obſerver agrees this Aſſertion, and thence concludes, That in ſuch his Government, he has no regard to this Opinion at all.</p>

Whereas, the expreſs Words of this Text, and the whole Tenor of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do plainly declare, That there ſhall be a Reſurrection, and do lay the whole Expatiation of future Recompences upon that Ground, and the Promiſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> declared in the Goſpel concerning it; without mentioning the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, or taking any manner of notice of it: So as in this Place Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has ſuppreſſed thoſe words, to which his quoted Expreſſion is by the Speaker apply'd, for which the Obſerver believes he deſerves a ſharp Cenſure; and that however, from the Miſ-quotations before Cited, his Readers ought to be wary how they confide upon his Fidelity in Caſes of the like Nature; in which they may do to truſt him no farther than they ſee him, or can ſearch the Truth of what he delivers: It being apparent, he is ſo much poſſeſt with his Opinion of the Soul's Immortality; than like the Bilious Eyes he has before mentioned, he thinks he ſees Arguments for it in thoſe Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which bend very ſtrongly againſt it.

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>There is ſomething in Plants like Senſe, in Brutes like Reaſon, and in Men like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> [The Obſerver ſaies] ſomething like the Inferiour Intellectual, Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Apprehenſion, Reaſon, and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, which is as great a Participation with the lower De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſeparate Spirits; as the Brutes have of the Rational, or the Plants have of the Senſitive Nature. The Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, further agrees with Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Metaphyſical Author. <hi>P.</hi> 59. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Quotes the Obſerver's Saying concerning Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who ſay, <hi>That the Souls of Brutes have ſeparate Subſiſtence after the Death of their Bodies; and there he ſaies, That Dr.</hi> Willis, <hi>did not think this Opinion merited the trouble of his Confutation.</hi> And both there, and here, the Obſerver is of the ſame Judgment, That this Opinion neither deſerves, or needs any other, or further
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107186:28"/>Refutation, than the repugnancy which it will find in the common Senſations of every ordinary Reader; except ſuch only, as can ſwallow and digeſt the <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Opinion of the Tranſmigrations of Souls. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> and from him receiv'd the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality, and rais'd out of it the Doctrine. of the <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> Teaching from thence, That the Soul's of Men departed, ſometimes entred into Infants, and ſometimes into the Whelps and Cubs of Beaſts, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally, That the Souls of Beaſts, Tranſmigrated into, and Animated the Bodies of Humane Infants, or of Beaſts; as it might happen to fall out. To <hi>Pythagoras, Plato</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and held alſo a Tranſmigration of Souls; but more reſtrained then that of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> imagining, <hi>That Souls of Men had in a former World, been ſeparate and Intelligent Spirits; and that for their Offences then committed, they were Doomed to Inhabit and Actuate Bodies of Clay, in our preſent World, in Nature of a Penalty, and as means of Purgation, of, and for the Offences by them committed in the former World, and that as ſoon as they were diſlodged from one Perſon, they muſt wait for opportunity to enter into another Perſon, or</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon <hi>of Mankind.</hi> This Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> bounded the Tranſmigration of Souls within the Compaſs of Mankind; excluding the Beſtial Race from ſuch a Communication with Men: Concerning which Doctrine, Mr. <hi>Lock Dict. Lib. fol.</hi> 189, ſaies, <hi>Taking (as we ordinarily now do) the Humane Soul for an Immaterial Subſtance, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon Matter; there would be no Abſurdity to ſuppoſe, That the ſame Soul may at different times, be united to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Bodies, and in each make up a Man.</hi> This Doctrine therefore of Tranſmigration of Souls from one Man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſeems to him a Rational Deduction from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Subſiſtence of ſuch a Soul, and accordingly the Opinion of ſuch a Tranſmigration ſpread it ſelf far and wide over the Face of the Earth; ſo as the Chriſtian <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107186:29"/>accepted of it, and <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome others of the Fathers, were of that Opinion. The <hi>Gallick</hi> and <hi>Britiſh Druides</hi> maintain'd it, and the moſt groſs part of it, <hi>viz. The Tranſmigration Reciprocal from Man to Beaſts,</hi> is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among the <hi>Gentile Indians, Tartarians, Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Japanners,</hi> in our own Times; grounding it upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Soul's compleat Subſiſtence in a State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver ſaies, That if he had to deal with ſuch Men as theſe; he would deal with them as with Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> by endeavouring to perſwade them, and offering to them ſuch Proofs as he could produce [as he does to this preſent Opponent] That the Soul of Man is not an Intelligent Subſtance, nor capable of ſubſiſting in a State of Separation from the Body; and if thereof he ſhould be able to Convince them, that Conviction would be a ſufficient and perfect Cure for all theſe Errors of theirs, and all other like Opinions concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>He further ſaies, <hi>The wiſer and holier any Man is, the more firmly he believes and rejoices in the Conſideration of the Soul's Immortality.</hi> Other Proof of this Aſſertion he gives none; ſo that we have but his bare Word for it, in the truth of which, the Obſerver has no great Confidence; and he believes, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is therein much miſtaken. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>Men will not be perſwaded, that, That Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which has ſo often embraced them, mill ever deſert them: But that God is Stronger than Death, and more Powerful than the Grave, and that they cannot believe, That their Souls ſhall ever fall down into a Dead unactive State; becauſe they have been Irradiated by the Divine Light and Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver Anſwers, Here are Two Aſſertions, Firſt, they will not believe, <hi>That God who has embraced them with his Goodneſs, will ever deſert them; but that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and deliver them from the Grave.</hi> This Aſſertion the Obſerver willingly grants. The Second Saying is, <hi>That
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107186:29"/>Mens Souls can never fall down into a Dead unactive State.</hi> This the Obſerver denies, and ſaies, That if by Souls he does not mean Perſons; his ſaying, <hi>That they are irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God's Grace,</hi> in any ſort, or way, abſtracted, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Body; his Aſſertion here, is Erroneous and Deceitful: For that he never has Proved, nor can Prove; That God ever beſtowed any thing upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Soul in a State of Separation from the Body. But all his Graces and Favours, Corrections and Puniſhments, are applied to the Perſon in <hi>Statu Compoſito,</hi> and not to either of his Conſtituent Parts in a State of Separation of the one from the other. <hi>P.</hi> 60. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>That many good Men have died with raiſed Expectations of entring immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bleſſed State.</hi> This the Obſerver believes to be true, and that Men Die with many other Conceptions and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors about them beſides this, and yet receive no harm or hinderance by any of them. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here, further Repeats divers like miſtakes amongſt the Philoſophers.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">P. </seg>61</label> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>He will not mention the Raptures of many Chriſtian Martyrs at the time of their departing, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Expectation.</hi> The Obſerver thinks, That ſuch Examples of this, as he can find among the Primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, would deſerve his Quotation. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That it may juſtly ſeem a great wonder, that many of the beſt Men have erred in this Point of great concernment, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Men, and thoſe of mean Parts and Credit, ſhould be in the right of of it,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver Anſwers, That this (among other like Accidents) is not ſo ſtrange as true. Whilſt the Learned World, thought the Earth to be the Center of the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Circumvolution, ſome very few there were, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd that Place to the Sun; and they at laſt are proved to be in the Right. Did not the Learned World (and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Governors of the Church) abſolutely deny the Being of <hi>Antipodes;</hi> which is now as apparent and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107186:30"/>clear a Truth, as that there are Countries called by the Names of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan.</hi> Do not all true Proſelytes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church profeſs firmly to believe, That there is no Salvation for any who Die excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church? And do not all Sectaries, and Diſſenters, and the very <hi>Quakers</hi> profeſs abſolutely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That their ways and modes of Worſhip, are the moſt Excellent that are to be found among the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, or any other Aſſemblies in the World; and are they not ready to expoſ themſelves to Dangers and Death, for the Maintenance and Advancement of their Profeſſion? Errors as they are. Was not the Truth of Religion juſtled into a very narrow room, when it was all compriſed in one ſingle Family, Deſpiſed, Hated and Perſecuted, by the Learned <hi>Chaldeans</hi> on the one ſide, and their Equals the <hi>Egyptians</hi> on another ſide; whilſt the vaſt compaſs of the Earth beſides, was muffled up in the dark Clouds of Ignorance; and neither knew any thing of God, or elſe apply'd themſelves to him by Devils, or <hi>Daemons,</hi> or other dumb ſhows of Idolatrous Figures; for maintenance of whoſe Vain Services, they were ready to ſpend their Blood, and put to Death all thoſe who durſt affront them. Of which Truth, Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Proto-Martyr <hi>Socrates</hi> is an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Evidence, who ſuffer'd Death, for daring to deny that, which the World at that time undoubtedly believ'd for a certain Truth.</p>
            <p>In theſe Pages Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Repeats the Words <hi>(wretchedly deceived)</hi> many times over.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver grants, and believes, That a vaſt number of very good Men have Died in the Opinion (Erroneous as it is) of the Soul's Immortality. But that was no more hurtful to them, than an holding either part of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning Predeſtination, Original Sin, or the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, or any other Speculative Opinions of that Kind: And that if the Obſerver's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107186:30"/>of the Materiality be true; the Perſons Dying in the belief of the Immortality, ſhall never find or know, that they were deceived in it.</p>
            <p>That Faith, and thoſe Manners, which will ſerve them at an Intermediate Judgment, will ſerve them as fully at the Laſt Judgment; their Works do follow them, and will ſerve them as well at the one Judgment as at the other: They will not be loſt or diminiſhed by the largeſt Account of Time which may paſs between their Deaths and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: As the Perſons riſing ſhall be perfect and known, yea, and the very ſame that Died, tho' they have ſuffered far greater Alterations than Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has before pretended. The Faith and Works of ſuch Dying Perſons, ſhall then alſo appear to be the ſame, which they were at their ſeveral Deaths. The Reſurrection and Laſt Judgment are certain, and clearly Proveable by a ſtrong Current of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: But the Intermediate Judgment, is neither likely, nor Proveable, by any clear Aſſertory Text of Scripture whatſoever. The Obſerver, Adviſes Men therefore to build their Expectations of future Recompenses upon the rockie and ſure Ground of the Reſurrection; rather than upon the ſoft and ſandy Ground of an Intermediate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver conceives it a very improper, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abſurd Courſe to bring a Man to Judgment whilſt the is aſleep; without firſt wakening him out of it. And we know that every where the Scripture calls Death a Sleep. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> (ſtoned to Death) <hi>fell aſleep. Thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus ſhall God bring with him. We that are alive ſhall not prevent them that are aſleep. If there be no Reſurrection, then all thoſe that are faln aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> All Dead Perſons are ſaid to ſleep with their Fathers, and all Men Naturally do know, that Death is a ſound Sleep, and has the common Reputation of ſomething beyond it; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is that, at the leaſt. We know further this Effect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107186:31"/>of a ſound Sleep, that whether a Man ſleep Four Hours, or Forty Hours, when he awakes he can find no difference, nor know any thing of the degrees of Time which have paſſed over him; and ſo for Forty thouſand Days, 4000 Years. When the Perſon ſhall be awaked, he can have no ſenſe or perceiving of any time that is paſſed over him; but riſes perfectly, as if he had but faln aſleep a ſhort time before, and then ſhall find himſelf the ſame that he was when he fell aſleep, and as able to Account for what he has done in the Fleſh, as he was in the beſt time of his Life: So as they who have no other Impediments, but their erroneous Tenet in this Point, ſhall not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deceived to their prejudice; but ſhall receive thoſe full and real Recompences which belong to their Faith and Manners.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here further Quotes his good Friend <hi>Cicero,</hi> whoſe Words make plainly for his Opinion; but are of little force for the convincing of the Obſerver, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes as much to the Bp. of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Thoughts, as he does to thoſe of <hi>Cicero;</hi> but concludes, <hi>amicus Cicero, amici Doctores, ſed magis amica veritas.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> pretends to offer a Sixth Abſurdity ariſing from the Opinion of the Materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which has little that needs Anſwer in it, and to that which needs it, a ſufficient Anſwer has been given it in the fore-going Pages.</p>

It begins with the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of tender Age, Teaching to Speak and Write truly, their own Mother-Tongue, and ſo to proceed in others, eſpecially the Learned Languages, and this is commonly termed, the Art of <hi>Grammar:</hi> After which, it Teaches to Speak, and Write Elegantly, Floridly, Teachingly and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately, and this is called the Art of <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> From Words, it proceeds to Teach the Arts of Things and Thinking, to Form Notions, or abſtracted Ideas, and to Divide, Compare, Compound, Collect, Propoſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; alſo to direct diſtinct Places and Repoſitories for Things of different Natures, and to rank them in fitting Orders for the ſupport and aſſiſtance of the Memory, and this Art is called <hi>Logick;</hi> as directing the Mind, in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and Diſpoſition of Things: Thence Men proceed to the Arts Mathematical, of <hi>Arithmetick, Geometry, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and <hi>Harmony;</hi> which help to fix Mens wandring Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Notions, to the Apprehenſion of known and certain Objects, and the Comprehenſion of them.</p>
            <p>Next we go on to the general Contemplation of Nature, and all Things that have known and certain Beings in the World, and this is called <hi>Phyſica;</hi> and proceeds to examine the Nature both of Heaven and Earth, the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the four Elements, and all their Inhabitants, and things pertinent to them; the divers ſorts of Earth, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Metals and Stones: So riſing to the Surface of it, and there examining the Graſſes, Herbs, Flowers and Plants;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107186:34"/>proceeding to the Inſects, Fiſhes, Fowls, Brutes and Men, examining their formerly call'd Specifick Forms and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; lately changed for the Terms, of Capacities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without a great difference of their ſignifications. For the better effecting ſuch Examinations, Men Daily make the beſt uſe they can of their Senſations, <hi>viz.</hi> of their Five Senſes, aſſiſted (as they muſt be) by their Rational Faculties, able and ready to Correct divers Miſtakes which the Senſual Faculties are Naturally liable unto. Thus Mens Senſes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Mind with ſuitable Objects for its Examination, and ſearching Men make Tryal of them all, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver belongs to them; the Parts of which they are Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Cauſes and Effects of them, their ſeveral manners of Working, and whatſoever by their Senſes can be found out concerning them: They ponder and ruminate upon them, and divide, compare, compound, and collect from them, frame Propoſitions concerning them; and thence In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as to themſelves ſeems moſt Reaſonable. Then they communicate their Opinions to other Men, whom they think capable of Judging in ſuch Caſes, and Diſpute and Argue the ſame with ſuch Perſons, as their preſent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions may require; ſometimes extending ſuch Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Foreign Regions and far diſtant Places: They examine the Traditions of their Fore-fathers, and what our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have ſaid and thought concerning them. They Read and Study the Books which have been Written upon ſuch Subjects from the earlieſt Times which they can attain unto, and thus they Cultivate and Enrich their Underſtandings, by ſtoring up in their Written Collections and Memories, the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, derived to them from the beginnings of Time, and the moſt remote Parts of the Earth; grounded upon the Teſtimonies of many Senſations and Experiments, which do not eaſily or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deceive the Expectations of ſuch as ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon them. The Obſerver Deſigns to apply this to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107186:34"/>the Queſtion now in Diſpute, and ſaies, He had paſs'd the 62d. Year of his Age under the apprehenſion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Soul's Immortality; and that then ſolitarily, and unmoved by any Diſcourſe or Writing; the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Queſtion, fell upon him. He was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced or Perſwaded by his Senſations, That the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Man's Body, was made up of Matter and Spirit, as thoſe of all other Sublunary Creatures were. The Graſs, Flowers, and Plants, have Matter and Spirit; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly to the ſearching Inquirers. The Infects have Matter of a light and weak Compoſure, and an Humour analogous to Blood and Spirit. The Fiſhes are watry, yet have ſome Blood, and ſome of the greateſt ſorts of them, have it in great quantities. The Fowls are light and Airy; their Matter being Fleſh and Bones, and their Spirits of Blood, which ſome of their greateſt ſorts, as Geeſe and Turkies have in conſiderable quantities. The Matter and Spirits of Brutes are very well known amongſt us, and it is viſible and palpable to us, That the Life of them is in their Blood, and that they never do, nor can Live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and that Breath is as neceſſary to them; and upon the ſame reaſon, that it is to Men. And <hi>Solomon</hi> Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon this Queſtion <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the 3d. ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Similar Natures of Men and Beaſts, <hi>they are generated alike, have need of a like Blood and Breath, and their Bodies return to the like duſt, and who knows what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is concerning their Spirits?</hi> He leaves that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, which is now the Subject of the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. But that the Life of both is in the Blood, <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and Experience verifies: For if one draw out of a Beaſt its whole Blood, and at another Orifice let into its Body the Blood of another Beaſt ſufficient for its repletion: the latter Beaſt muſt Die by the loſs of its Blood, but the firſt Beaſt may Live, by the newly received Blood; and be affected with no perceivable harm by ſuch a change.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107186:35"/>And the ſame alſo befals Men: If we let out all the Man's Blood at one Orifice, and in the mean while intromit the Blood of a Calf, or a Sheep into that Man's Body at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orifice; the Beaſt muſt Die, but the Man will Live, without any clear ſenſe of the loſs of his own Blood: Nor will he only live or move, by the Virtue of his new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Blood, but he will have the uſe of all his Senſes, Speech, Intellect and Memory, as he had before; and which without ſuch freſh ſupply of Blood, would have been utterly loſt.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver further conſider'd, That by a failure of any of the ſenſitive Organs, the Man may, and often does loſe the uſe of that Senſe; ſo as the Spirit cannot act the Senſe, but only in its proper Organ, and both of them muſt be ſound for the production of it: The Spirit alſo can Speak by the Tongue, but not without it; it can Imagine in the fore-part of the Brain, but no where elſe; it can Eſtimate and Judge in the middle-part of the Head, and Remember only in the back-part of it. If the Blood and Spirit be over Thin and Watry, Phlegmatick, Scorbutick, or too Hot and Feveſcent, too Salt or Sharp; the Brain may be ill affected from any of theſe, or the like Cauſes; which Phyſicians intend to remedy by Purging, or reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a right State the Stomack, Liver, or other Parts where the Sanguification is made. If the Imagination be tainted, they apply Fomentations, Blood-letting, or Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the fore-part of the Head; if the Judgment be crazed, they apply to the middle-part of the Head; if the Memory fail, they do ſo to the hind-part of the Head; and divers times with very good ſucceſs, performing divers Cures thereupon. He further Conſider'd, That in Diſtempers of the Brain, and failures of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Phyſicians do Adviſe, and Men Practiſe with good ſucceſs the changes of Air, Diet, Company, freſh or ſweet Smells, Mirth, Jollity with a Cup of good Wine; and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107186:35"/>good Effects have follow'd all theſe Preſcriptions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. The Obſerver ponder'd and conceiv'd within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That all theſe were Natural and proper Remedies for correcting the Diſtempers of the Blood, and reſtoring the imbecillities of the Organs, or removing ſuch Obſtructions as hinder'd the Operation of them; but neither any of them, nor altogether, were likely to effect or work any thing at all upon an Immaterial Intelligent Spirit. Men tell us, That this Spirit Acts and Works all that it does, by Interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Material Spirits of the Blood; but they give us no other Proof of what they ſay, than that the Bodily Organs are not, cannot be Acted, but by means of theſe Spirits. That we grant, and ſay, That there neither is, nor needs an Intelligent Spirit, for the Acting of them; but that they of themſelves do Act, and are enough to Act the Bodily Organs, Daily ſupplied as they are with Food and Nouriſhment, from the Ambient World; as a River is ſupplied from its Fountains, and Plants, with Sap extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Earth. If the Root cannot extract that, the Plant muſt die; if the Fountains fail, the livers dry up; and if the Sensitive Creatures want nouriſhment, their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fail, and their Limbs and Bodies wither, conſume and die for want of ſuch Supplies gas are ſuitable to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations wrought upon the Obſerver, to make a further ſearch into this Diſquiſition: He ruminated long upon it, and then propounded it to other People whom he thought capable of it; but found not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who had a compliance for it, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the contrary. The main Argument that they rely'd upon for the defence of it, was the largeneſs of it ſpread in the World, and amongſt the Divines and Doctors of it, whence it was become ſo radicated; that if it was an Error, it was become irremediable, and that the endeavouring to remove it out of Mens Minds might do more harm to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107186:36"/>Peace of the Church, than the Planting of a new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (tho' true) could do good by the Truth of it. This Argument <hi>à Commodo</hi> did not enough prevail with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver to give over and deſert his Deſign and Search con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Point; but he ſtill Ruminated, Conferr'd, and Read, as Opportunity ſerv'd him: He ſearch'd the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Read them many times over, and Noted upon a Paper whatſoever he there met with concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: He procur'd all Books that Treated of it, and which he could attain by Buying or Borrowing, and gave them an attentive Peruſal, and then Writ down his own Thoughts, and Collections upon them, and Publiſh'd that Pamphlet how oppoſed by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in ſuch a manner, as the Obſerver cannot tell in what manner to Reply to it. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has ſo twiſted and complicated together his <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſick,</hi> that it is not eaſie to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh which of his Expreſſions belongs to one, which to another, and delivered what he ſaies in ſuch an Athletick and Domineering Style; that he has ſometimes attracted a Sympathizing return from the Obſerver, different from the uſual courſe of his Nature: He apprehends that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> intended with <hi>Alexander</hi> to cut in ſunder the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot of this Queſtion, by his ſharp and piercing Style: But he thinks, he is there-from well Defended by the Shield and Buckler of Faith and Patience, the Faith and Belief, That he holds the Truth in this Point, and a Patience ſupported with a knowledge, That New Truths are not to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without an apparent Conſequence of Suffering. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4, 5. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a double Direction in this Caſe, one in direct Words contrary to the other; and the Obſerver has happened to follow the Direction of both Places, ſometimes of the one, ſometimes of the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it happen'd, and (perhaps) as <hi>Solomon</hi> intended.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver did Incite Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to Write an Anſwer to his Pamphlet, expecting from him ſuch an one, as would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107186:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>be Knowing, Solid, and Temperate; inſtead of which, Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Treatiſe is Printed with little of the firſt Requiſite in it, and nothing at all of the other two; as tho' he did not deſign to draw a Sinner from the Error of his way, but weakly, <hi>Triumphum canere ante Victoriam.</hi> He ſaies, <hi>Men will be apt to cenſure all Philoſophy, for the ill uſe the Obſerver has made of it in his Pamphlet.</hi> The Obſerver ſaies, That there are ill uſes made by Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> Arguments, produced concerning the uncertainty of Mens Perſons, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening by the Alterations pertaining to their Bodies and Souls, and ſuch other like Parts of his Treatiſe: But thoſe that conſider the Scheme of Philoſophy that the Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has now laid down, cannot without contradiction to their own Senſations, pretend a probable Reaſon of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to it: If that Herd amongſt which Mr. <hi>M,</hi> Officiates, ſhall happen to make any Quarrel to it; it will but prove the ſtate of their own Ignorance, and that they Err in ſo doing; as perhaps, they may be found to do in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver did ever, and does ſtill deſire a ſober know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Canvas of his Opinion. The Primitive <hi>Greek</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Diſturbed and Divided by the Hereſies of <hi>Sabellius, Arius,</hi> and divers others, call'd upon <hi>Eleutherius</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſtand up for the Catholick Doctrine, and the Peace of the Chriſtian Church: So the Obſerver is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to incite and ſtir up the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whoſe Light is now great in the Church, that as he has lately Written excellently well concerning the Trinity; ſo he will take upon him to Treat fully and purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Queſtion, if his Age and Infirmity will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; Conferring thereupon with his moſt able Brethren, and communicating to ſome of them his Labours as they are Written in ſingle Sheets, during the courſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which may have a double Advantage.

            <p>Our Lawyers are very cautious in their Proceedings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Queſtions of great Moment: If the great Counſellors differ amongſt themſelves in a Point in Law, the Matter is brought to Tryal by Proceſs in one of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where it is Argued before the Judges of it; and if they alſo differ upon the Point, it is carried by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, into the Chequer-Chamber, to be there Tryed before all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> who ſit and hear it Argued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them by the ableſt Lawyers on either ſide, three, four, or five times, at ſeveral conſiderable Diſtances, Spaces, or Terms; that there may be time enough given for the full Inſpection, or Conſideration of it: And after they have heard what can be ſpoken on either ſide, then the Judges themſelves Argue the Point as largely as they pleaſe; each declaring his own Opinion thereupon: And then, if there be a conſiderable number of Diſſenters against the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Opinion, they Adjourn the Caſe yet further, <hi>propter difficultatem,</hi> to further Days and Times, having ſufficient intervals; ſuch as map ſtill give more leiſure for a fuller Conſideration: And in fine, if the diſſenting Party ſtill hold to be very conſiderable; they Adjourn the Caſe before the Upper-Houſe of Parliament, and there it is again Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Counſel on both ſides, as often as the Lords think fit to Appoint: Then the Judges Argue again, and deliver their Opinions with the Reaſons thereof; then ſuch of the Lords as pleaſe, ſpeak to it, and it is at laſt finally Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the Majority of Voices in the Lords Houſe; after which, it paſſes for Law in all the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and ſtands for a Rule in the Caſe Diſputed; and in all other like Caſes.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver further ſaies, That if the Fore-named
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107186:37"/>Learned Biſhop will take the pains to Examine the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars alledged by him in this and his former larger Treatiſes, and give ſuch Anſwers to them, as upon Conference he ſhall think fit to do: And let the Staff fall which way it will, he will hereafter be ſilent without publickly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting or Writing againſt the ſaid Biſhop's declared Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo delivered and confirmed as afore-ſaid. He knows that the ſaid Biſhop has Defended the Opinion of the Immortality, in his Writings: But he takes the Biſhop for a Perſon of great Integrity, and that he is a Old, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as near Death as himſelf: He knows of himſelf, That the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> offered him, to give a falſe Verdict in this, or the like Caſe, would be utterly deſpiſes by him: And he conceives full as well of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; and therefore dare remit the Point now in Diſpute, to his Determination, as afore-ſaid. <hi>P.</hi> 63. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>The Material Opinion cannot ſtand, but upon the ſuppoſition of a continual Courſe of Miracles to make it good; which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Abſurd and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nphiloſophical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver Replies (granting the Rule) That to Prove by Miracles is unphiloſophical; and that he holds it convenient in this Place to Examine which of the Two Opinions now in Diſpute, ſtand the moſt in need of Miracles to Prove the Truth of it, and which of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Parties, make moſt uſe of that ſort of Argument. The Material Opinion, he ſays, has only one wonderful Work in it, <hi>viz.</hi> The great Effect of God's Wiſdom and Power, in producing Life, Growth, Motion, Affection, Senſation, Perception, Imagination, Judgment, Memory, all ſorts of Thinking, by his Skilful contexture of Matter and Spirit together; which our Opponents are pleaſed to expreſs by the Terms of Matter and Motion. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, That the Skill and Power of Divinity can in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner produce theſe Effects. But Mr. <hi>M. obiter</hi> or tranſient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grants, That the Skill and Power of Omnipotence, can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107186:38"/>Effect ſuch Things if he pleaſes, by Natural means, <hi>applicando activa paſſivis;</hi> as we ſee he gives the vaſt Body of the Sea a Motion with divers variations; which Men cannot yet comprehend: So has he given the Planets, Stars and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heavenly Bodies, a perpetual Motion, generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but with ſuch variations, as Men cannot comprehend or underſtand: Plants and Trees Flouriſh and Decay, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, they ſhoot out Leaves, Bloſſom and Fruit, in a wonderful variety, the next Cauſes of which Men cannot find out: Fowls and Brutes, Live, Grow, Move, uſe their Senſes and Affections, and ſuch low degrees of Phantaſie, Memory, Eſtimation or Choice as they have by the Virtue and Activity of the Spirits and Blood before-mentioned, without Mens being able to apprehend the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of it: And ſo we may ſay, concerning the activity of the Wind amongſt the Organ-pipes, a thing which we every Day ſee with our Eyes, hear with our Ears, and handle with our Hands, and yet are not able throughly to diſcuſs and reſolve the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of all thoſe Actions and Varieties which are Performed by it. The fore-going Inſtances have been produced to Prove a Simile that ſuch like Things have been made and done by God, and are ſtill continued and ſubject to our view in the World; as Wonderful Effects of the great Skill and Power of God, and which Men are not able to comprehend or underſtand. We proceed to the Immaterial Intelligent Spirit, and require of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Immortaliſts, ſome ſort of Proofs maintaining their Opinion, tho' they ſhould be but a Simile. We deſire them to produce at leaſt ſome one Inſtance in Nature where God acts Matter by an Immaterial Intelligent Spirit: And the Obſerver conſiders, they cannot produce any one Inſtance of ſuch a Conjunction out of the whole Book of Nature, except this one, which they have invented, concerning the Conſtitution of Man; and therefore it is no wonder that they are put to the coining of Miracles for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107186:38"/>of the ſame. Two of which ſhall here be examined. The Wits of Men have never been able to conceive any more ways for the production of the Soul of Man, but theſe Three, <hi>viz.</hi> by Generation, by Pre-exiſtence, or new Creation of ſuch Souls upon every Procreation of a Body. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and his Aids reject the very true way of producing Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Generation; being convinced, that whatſoever is Generated, grows, decays and is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Orig. Sacr. P.</hi> 432. our Learned Biſhop ſays, <hi>Nothing in the World produced by Generation, can be incorruptible.</hi> To avoid therefore this Rock of producing the Soul by Generation (tho' it be never ſo true) <hi>Pherecydes</hi> the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Immaterial Opinion, with his Scholars and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and thoſe who came after them, pretended another ſort of Original of the Soul. The more Ancient held, <hi>That Mens Souls did Pre-exiſt long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came into the ſeveral Bodies, and had been Exiſtent in a former World, before the preſent World, and for Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces given to God in their former Stations, they were Doomed to inhabit Bodies of Clay in this World, ſometimes of Men and ſometimes of Beaſts; as a Purgatorial Puniſhment upon them; that they liv'd in ſuch Bodies, as in Cages and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, deſiring continually to be delivered from them, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape thence into the open Air.</hi> But the latter and Chriſtian <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> amongſt whom, ſome of the Fathers ſay, <hi>They Believ'd, That God at the Creation of the World, made a vaſt number of Humane Souls, enough by coming, going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, to Actuate and Inhabit all ſuch Humane Bodies as ſhould after be Generated in the World; and that all Mens Souls are ſtill of that Pre-exiſtent Nature.</hi> But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and his preſent Aids (upon divers inconveniencies found in this Opinion) have utterly rejected this ſort of Original of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls; and give themſelves up to maintain this ſort of Original of them, <hi>viz. The Opinion of God's new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Soul, for every new Procreation of a Humane Body, be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107186:39"/>the ſame never ſo foul and Beaſtly, in Adultery, Inceſt, or the Conjunction of Men with Beaſts: If the Product fall out to be of Humane ſhape, God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is ready at every ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to make, and does Create a new, clean and ſpotleſs Said, to Actuate and Inhabit ſuch a newly Procreated Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver hereupon conceives, That all Creations are the Miraculous Works of God! They do not tell us whether their ſort of Creation be out of Matter, or <hi>Ex ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilo;</hi> but which ſoever of thoſe ways it be, it is however a Miraculous Work of God: And by this courſe ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles muſt be multiplied continually over the Face of the whoſe Earth; and through the Minutes of Time which paſs through the Ages of it. Another Miracle neceſſary for the maintenance of the Immaterial Doctrine, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuch new Creation of Souls, is this, That theſe new Created, Pure, Innocent Souls, are put, thruſt, or caſt into the Seminal Matter not exceeding perhaps the bigneſs of a Nutt, derived and coming from the Loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> and tinctured (like an unſavory Cask) with a foul Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of Original Sin: This unhappy Intelligent Spirit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently infected with that abominable Poyſon, and going on to increaſe in Conjunction with ſuch a Body, is by no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force, able to ſhake off this Deplorable Corruption; but it goes on increaſing together with the Body and the Soul, till they both together Taſte deeply the ill Effects of it in this Life; and when ſeparated, this, at firſt Pure and Innocent Soul, in the Natural Courſe of it, falls or is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to be a Companion of Devils, and a fellow-ſufferer in the Torments of Hell: And this is a ſecond Miracle, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the maintenance of the Soul's Immortality. They are both of them extremely improbable and very little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the Goodneſs and Glory of God. To theſe a Third Immaterial Doctrine ſhall be added neceſſary for the maintenance of that opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Souls of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons go immediately before God, and receive a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107186:39"/>a Judgment and Doom from him within a ſhort time after their Deaths. The Obſerver has ſaid in his larger Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and repeats it here in this Place, That if the Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts can by Reaſon or Scripture make a clear Proof of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of theſe Three Tenets which are all neceſſary for the maintenance of their Doctrine, <hi>viz. Of this new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls: This ſort of infecting them with Original Sin: Or, that there is an intermediate Judgment betwixt Mens Deaths and the Reſurrection:</hi> If they can make a good clear Proof of any one of theſe Points, from Reaſon and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or from either of them; the Obſerver will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſubmit to their Judgment in the main Point of the Immortality.</p>

            <p>The Obſerver denies this Aſſertion and ſaies, That the knowledge of Superiour Spirits has two other Originals, <hi>viz.</hi> Senſation and Revelation, and we do plainly know and perceive more concerning Immaterial Spirits, by the effects of their Operations and ſuch Revelations as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes of them; than either is Revealed to us, or can be perceived by us, of ſuch an Immaterial Spirit as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> pretends to be in us. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own Souls muſt neceſſarily go before the knowledge of God.</hi> The Obſerver ſaies, That both by Reaſon and Revelation, we may, and do attain to a more large know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and a greater certainty of his Being and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than Men yet ever have had, or are ever likely to have of the Immaterial Intelligent Soul of Man. <hi>P.</hi> 73. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Quotes a ſaying of <hi>Epicurus, That God is not angry, or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Men. Which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is a Notion more befitting</hi> Sardanapalus <hi>than a Deity.</hi> This Comment of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Quotation, ſpeaks him (in the Obſerver's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) a Man of a narrow Capacity; and therefore he will endeavour to inlarge his Thoughts upon this Subject.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107186:40"/>It paſſes for an accepted Rule, That if the Words of a Speaker or Writer, may fairly and eaſily be taken in a good Senſe, it is a ſign of ill Nature, at leaſt, to take them in a bad one.</p>
            <p>To underſtand the Words of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> both in a true and a good Senſe, Men muſt reflect with great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon ſuch an Idea as the Scriptures have Revealed, and Reaſon Teaches to Believe concerning the Being of God. <hi>Job</hi> 23.3. <hi>O that I knew where I might find God, he works round about me, but I cannot perceive him; with what words ſhall one ſpeak of him? Surely if one ſpeak of him, he that doth ſo ſhall even be ſwallowed up and confounded.</hi> We cannot order our Words concerning him, nor have we an Order of Words that can reach him: He has no particular Faculties, Powers, or Parts; but being One and entire, is All in One. <hi>Concerning him,</hi> Job 40.5. <hi>once have I ſpoken, but I will not Anſwer, yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> This Tranſcendent Immenſity, having no Parts; contained in no Place; affected with no Time; touched with no Paſſion; filling, and in himſelf containing all Places and Things; Guiding without Care; Working without Labour; Commanding without Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Compelling without Force; Rewarding without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; Puniſhing without Provocation; Knowing, Supporting; Supplying and Governing all Things, in all Times and Places at once, with leſs Motion than that we call <hi>nutu aut intuitu;</hi> this One, this All, in whom all Things are, what is his Name, and what is his Son's Name?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has ſet forth and magnified the Vigor, Velocity and Extent of Man's Imagination and Intellect; but they can by no means extend to utter true and adequate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions concerning this Being: Concerning whom <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends ſay, <hi>If thou art wicked, what harm doſt thou to him? thy righteouſneſs may profit a man like thy ſelf; but it can by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107186:40"/>no means affect that high Majeſty.</hi> Man's Goodneſs or Badneſs, cannot raiſe in God either Joy or Grief, Pleaſure or Diſpleaſure: He has no more Affections than he has Parts: He's free from all Diſturbances, Paſſions, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, acting Juſtice and Goodneſs through the whole ſpace of his unconceivable Dominion, reſting in his own Clearneſs, Conſtancy and Serenity: He diſtributes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Created World thoſe Orders which among us upon Earth, are the effects or products of Pleaſure or Diſpleaſure, and diſtributes Rewards and Puniſhments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the incitements of Wrath, but by the due and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble directions of his Juſtice, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. Men do not chooſe, or ſuffer mortal Judges that are inclinable to Wrath, Fear, Pity, Love, or any other Affections: And he that is the Judge of all the World does abſolute Right among his Creatures, without Affection, Paſſion, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or any thing like that we call Pleaſure or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure amongſt Men. <hi>P.</hi> 75. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>You may tell Men of a future Reſurrection and Judgment as long as you will, but if they can ſtifle Reaſon ſo far as to disbelieve the Soul's Immortality; they may far more plauſibly deny the Article of the Reſurrection:</hi> As if he thought the Proof of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality was ſtronger than that of the Reſurrection. To which the Obſerver Anſwers, That there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the clearneſs of the Proofs of the Reſurrection, and of the Immortality: For that thoſe of the Reſurrection are clear and ſtrong throughout? the whole New Teſtament; but thoſe of the Immortality, are neither poſitive nor firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluding.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>Others will ſay, as the Tree falls ſo it lies.</hi> And the Obſerver agrees in the Truth of it, that ſo it muſt do until the Reſurrection, <hi>That there is no Device nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the Grave;</hi> nor any ſort of alteration after Death, or between that and the Reſurrection; but <hi>as the Tree falls ſo it lies,</hi> untill that Time, and as Death leaves us ſo Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107186:41"/>ſhall finds us. <hi>P.</hi> 76. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Demands, <hi>What good purpoſe can there be in over-throwing the Immortality, and eſtabliſhing that of the Reſurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver Anſwers, The purpoſe is, to eſtabliſh Truth, and reverſe Error, and to plant Expectation of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences upon Sound and Rocky Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reſurrection, which is irrefragable to any that believe the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>VVhereas, ſuch an Expectation built upon the ſandy Ground of the Immortality, may be over-thrown by dint of Reaſon, and other Scriptures, and therewith, all muſt fall which has been built upon it, and great will be the fall of it; endangering the whole Doctrine of future Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences after the Death of the Perſon.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">P. </seg>77</label> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Opinion of the Materiality is directly contrary to the avowed Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. And for Proof thereof, he Quotes Expreſſions of a Prayer uſed in the Office of Burial, and thoſe of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, dilating upon the Parable of <hi>Dives;</hi> neither of which is a poſitive Proof of our Church's Opinion in this Point, nor ſo ſtrong a Proof of it, as if it had been aſſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Thirty nine Articles, or in the Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, or in their Book of Canons: But he does agree, That it is a good preſumptive Proof of the Church's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about it; and he doth alſo agree, That the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Divines of this Church does ſtand with, and ſupport the Belief of the Soul's Immortality.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>That no honeſt Materialist, can declare his unfeigned conſent to that Prayer Quoted out of the Office of the Burial.</hi> And this ſhall be agreed to him, but proves no more, than that in this particular, the ſaid honeſt Man may hold his peace at the reciting of that Prayer, and not join with the reſt of the Company in it. And Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies further, <hi>That if the Material Opinion be true, the Diſſenters from the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſhould be more in the right, if they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107186:41"/>ſented in this Point alſo, from the Tenet of our Church.</hi> This alſo ſhall be agreed to him. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>P.</hi> 78. <hi>There is no Point of Doctrine wherein the Diſſenters differ from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ſo important as this of the Soul's Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi> To this alſo the Obſerver agrees, and ſays, That he believes all the particular Points of Doctrine wherein the Diſſenters differ from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are Things of very ſmall moment in themſelves, but are blown up by the Wind of Phantaſie to the ſhow of a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the dazzled Eyes of the Diſſenters only, and are truly of no real importance to Religion. They ſeem to ground their Offence upon our Church's obſerving ſuch outward Modes of VVorſhip, as have too near a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and accommodation with thoſe uſed by the VVhore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Which Opinion if they will follow in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as well as Diſcipline, they muſt forſake the Opinion of the Immortality; becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain that Opinion, and it has been by a General Council Ordained to be <hi>de fide</hi> amongſt them. Our Church of <hi>England</hi> does nor require ſo ſtrict an Adherence to the Points of Doctrine or Diſcipline maintained by it, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does; but opens the Bowels of her Compaſſion to her weak Children diſſenting from ſome particular Parts of her Doctrine or Diſcipline; provided, they be ſtill willing and ready to acknowledge Her for their Mother, and ſubmit to Her Orders generally, or in Things wherein they have not particular Reaſons to the contrary, and eſpecially when they profeſs a readineſs to appeal to Her moſt conſiderate Judgment, for the Hearing, or Determining, ſuch Doubts and Scruples, as at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may fall upon them.</p>
            <p>The Obſerver has already called upon the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> aſſiſted by the moſt Knowing Perſons of his Faculty, to produce their Reaſons, and give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Point; and if he, and they, ſhall at preſent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107186:42"/>wave the delivery of their Opinions in this Point: He Appeals further to a National Synod, or Convocation, to which he is ever ready to ſubmit his Opinion; with this caution, not to be Determined by a bare Majority of Voices, nor by a leſs Majority, than Two third Parts of the whole Aſſembly: As is reaſonably obſerved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Conclave, and as was pretended to be obſerved in the <hi>Trent</hi>-Council, where they ſaid, They did not Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Points of Doctrine, if a great, or conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Voices did refuſe to conſent to the Agreement of the <hi>Major</hi> Part: But our Diſſenters on the contrary, like Froward and very Ill-natured Children, do utterly Reject the Authority of their Mother the Church. She like a tender Parent extends her Arms to receive them, ſets open the Doors of her Oratories, and calls them to her kind and wonted Imbraces; exhorting them to enter again into her Communion, with a readineſs to forgive all that is paſt and an inclination to heal or even to bear with their Weakneſſes and Infirmities, and their errors of Opinions, in Doctrine or Diſcipline: Whilſt they like Waſps (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furniſhed with Stings than Honey) ſeek rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy than cultivate the Hives and Stocks wherein they have been preſerved and nouriſhed.

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Pherecydes</hi> as the firſt among the Philoſophers, who Defended (or Invented) this Doctrine of the Immortality, as before has been obſerved, and ſhall here be granted.

               <hi>P.</hi> 80. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Quotes <hi>Pythagoras</hi> as <hi>Pherecydes</hi>'s Scholar, and next maintainer of the Immortality. The Obſerver will mind the Reader of the effect of this Opinion, held by the latter and Learned, from the former, <hi>viz. That their ſort of Soul had a perfect Pre-exiſtence, before it came into the Body of a Man, and held that ſame exiſtence after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Body, whereby it was capable of Animating ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, Horſe, Camel, or Dog, Fiſh, Fowl, or any other living Creature; and that Souls did continually undergo ſuch changes of Habitations, throughout the World from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</hi> This Opinion therefore, the Obſerver ſaies; ought to be rejected, <hi>quia ducit ad abſurdum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>Plato</hi> Travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> to gather Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the School of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> there, and gather'd from thence his Opinion of the Pre-exiſtence of Souls, which he after chang'd ſo far, as to conceive, <hi>That the Tranſmigration of Souls was not common to Men and Beaſts; but that they went only from one Man to another, and were put into Bodies for Pennances and Purgatories, and were incloſed in them as in Cages or Priſons, which they were deſirous to leave with the firſt opportunity.</hi> An Opinion convinc'd of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Error by every Man's Daily Experience: Which Proves to us, That there is no Union in the World more Natural, pleaſing and deſired, than that of Soul and Body, nor whoſe ſeparation is more grievous than theirs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Quotes Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Verſes <hi>P.</hi> 81. of which no more ſhall be ſaid; but like Lips, like Lettice. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here further Quotes <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> both which we give up to him as Groſs and Erroneous Immortaliſts. <hi>P.</hi> 82. He pretends to Quote <hi>Socrates,</hi> when his Quotation is only what <hi>Plato</hi> puts into <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Mouth, who in this feigned Dialogue, makes <hi>Socrates</hi> ſay what he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here gives us <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion to the ſame effect, and near in the ſame Terms, that the common Opinions of Men now hold it, and hence it ſeems the Chriſtian <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:107186:43"/>deriv'd it, and deliver'd it to the Scholars of their Schools, who ſpread the ſame accordingly, ſupported by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Words of <hi>cannot kill the Soul:</hi> Wording our Saviour's Doctrine according to that Tenet which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and was then common in the World. <hi>P.</hi> 83. Here he goes ſtill on to deliver ſuch Words as <hi>Plato</hi> is pleaſed to put into the Mouth of <hi>Socrates.</hi> He further Quotes <hi>Plotinus</hi>'s Saying, <hi>If we could ſee the Soul in its own naked Eſſence, we ſhould not doubt of its Immortality.</hi> And this is agreed by the Obſerver; who therefore deſires Mr <hi>M.</hi> to ſhow us this Soul in its own naked Eſſence, or tell us by what ſearch we may come to ſuch a Sight of it. His fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words are unpracticable. <hi>P.</hi> 84. He Quotes <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> whoſe Words ſhall be left to the World to conſider, not believed by the Obſerver. <hi>P.</hi> 85. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Quotes the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who ſay, <hi>The departed Souls are turned into Hero's, ſome good, and ſome bad.</hi> Believe them who liſt.</p>
            <p>Then he ſaies, out of <hi>Seneca, The Humane Soul is a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dwelling in a Humane Body.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaies, <hi>This is too high an Expreſſion.</hi> (he might as well have ſaid, he knew it to be falſe.) <hi>P.</hi> 86. Is Quoted <hi>Seneca,</hi> who calls <hi>the Body the Priſon of the Soul.</hi> Like a right <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> and deriving his Opinions from them. The Reader may conſider, <hi>Plutarch</hi> was an Heathen Philoſopher, and likely knew nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reſurrection of the Perſon. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here further ſaies, <hi>That ſuch Chriſtians may be aſhamed, who ſtand in need of Inſtructions from a Heathen, concerning the Soul's Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> The Obſerver ſaies, That rather ſuch Chriſtians have reaſon to be aſhamed, who derive their Opinion of the Immortality from Thoughts of Heathen Idolaters, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Inſtructions concerning it. <hi>P.</hi> 87. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>That the Opinion of the Immortality, was the ground of their Worſhipping their departed Hero's.</hi> Which was their Idolatry, and one very bad effect of their conceited Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. <hi>P.</hi> 88. <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Words here Quoted, ſeem fit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107186:43"/>to be put into Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s own Mouth. <hi>If I be miſtaken in this Point of the Immortality, I will ſtill maintain it, Error though it be, nor will I be drawn out of this Error as long as I live; becauſe it pleaſes me, and I am delighted with the apprehenſion of it.</hi> He ſaies further, <hi>That the</hi> Platoniſts <hi>and</hi> Stoicks <hi>(the earlieſt maintainers of this Doctrine) ſpeak of the Soul, as if it were an Incarnate Deity.</hi> But it is to be hoped, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> will confeſs, That they Err'd very groſsly in it: As the Obſerver thinks they did in the whole Point of the Soul's Immortality. <hi>P.</hi> 89. <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> held, <hi>There are future Rewards and Puniſhments; and that the Soul is impriſoned in the Body.</hi> In the Firſt, his Opinion is true; in the Second falſe.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Chapter has gone no higher in the deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Opinion, than to the time of <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> who liv'd after the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity; which time was leſs than 600 Years before our Lord's Incarnation, and 1000 Years after the Birth of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prophet and Law-giver of the <hi>Jews;</hi> from whoſe Writings the Obſerver pretends to Derive and Prove his Opinion of the Soul's Materiality: Taking the ſaid Soul and Life of the Creature to lie and reſide in the Blood of it; as being the Spirits of ſuch Blood, inflamed and glowing, which riſe firſt from the Heart to the Head; where being made lucid, they act the Brain and the Cephaline Organs, and thence are conveyed by the Nerves, Fibres, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, to all the Muſcles, Joints, Members and Parts of the Body: All which, are invigorated and Acted by ſuch glowing Blood, and the Spirits of it, ſo knownly and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently; as that where the paſſage of this Blood is obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſo that it cannot arrive at any Part or Member of the Body; that Part withers and becomes uſeleſs to the Perſon, till ſuch Obſtructions be removed: And then it may, and often does recover; ſometimes to the wonder of thoſe who effect ſuch Cures. We have ſaid before, That the Blood of a Beaſt caſt by Transfuſion into the Body of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107186:44"/>a Man, will Act the Perſon and all his Faculties of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Senſe, Speech and Underſtanding, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that his own Blood perform'd it before, and without any great, or even perceivable difference: Alſo if the Blood be totally corrupted, or exhauſted; the Perſon muſt certainly Die, beyond all hope of help or recovery by Humane Art or Knowledge whatſoever: And with this Doctrine, the Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems fully to agree, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. <hi>The Life of the Fleſh is in the Blood. And I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an Attonement for your Souls; for it is the Blood that maketh an Attonement for the Soul</hi> (or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>He that hunts and kills a Beaſt, or Fowl, ſhall pour out the Blood thereof, and cover it with Duſt; for it is the Life of all Fleſh; the Blood of it is for the life thereof: Therefore ye ſhall eat the Blood of no manner of Fleſh; for the life of all Fleſh is the Blood thereof.</hi> This Doctrine is Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in a Hiſtory more Ancient than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time by 500 Years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. <hi>But fleſh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof ſhall ye not eat; and ſurely your blood of your Lives will I require at the hand both of man and beaſt. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſheds this blood of the life of man, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> And thus we find it Proved by the higheſt Antiquity, and greateſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that has been in the World, That Blood is the Life of Man and Beaſt; ſo as the Life is conveyed with and by the Blood, to every Part and Member of the Body: Where it comes, it enlivens; and the Part where it cannot come withers and dies: If the Spirits of it fail, the Perſon grows feeble, and not able to perform any great matter, either Active or Contemplative; till by reſt or nouriſhment, or both, they ſhall be again reſtored or recruited: And this is teſtified by Daily Senſation and Experience. We know theſe Spirits can Act in this manner Daily and every Day, if thus they be recruited; and if ſuch Recruits fail, the Perſon waxes feeble and can do nothing, but grow more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107186:45"/>feeble ſtill to Death, in a ſhort time, for want of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What theſe Spirits do, we are ſure they can do, without knowing they have, or need aſſiſtance from an Immaterial Intelligent Spirit. <hi>Quod fieri poteſt per pauciora, non debet fieri per plura, &amp; Natura nihil facit fruſtra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conclude then, we may, That the Blood is the Life of Man; and the inflamed Particles of it, are thoſe admirable fine Spirits, which Act the Perſon and all his Powers: And when this Flame of Life extinguiſhes, Man Dies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy or poſſible recovery by Humane Power.</p>

He ſaies further, <hi>That the Obſerver does not Prove in his Pamphlet, the Soul's periſhing with the Body; but ſay it only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver Anſwers, That the Saying in that Place, was enough to excite Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to a better Proof of his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul's Immortality: And for his Ancient and Modern Arguments, which he ſaies are unanſwered; the Saying ſhews, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> did not underſtand the Subject, or Deſign of that Pamphlet, which he pretends to Anſwer; there appearing in it no intent to Diſpute with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but only to excite in him a deſire and endeavour better to Prove what he had before Aſſerted. Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s following Words expreſs no more, but his own Nature and Civility. <hi>P.</hi> 94. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Obſerver does not prove the Mortality of the Souls of Beaſts.</hi> The Obſerver replies; This was no part of his Undertaking either there, or here, nor do's he think it needful to be done any where; becauſe he yet never met with any Man who maintain'd the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107186:45"/>Opinion that Brutal Souls have any ſubſiſtence after the death of their Bodies; if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> pretend to think that they ſo do; he ſhall here be pointed to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.12, <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. where <hi>David</hi> compares Men, as good as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to the <hi>Beaſts that periſh [utterly.]</hi> And his Son <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 3.21. ſeems to know, That the Spirit of a Beaſt goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Earth, and he ſuſpects there, that the Spirit of a Man may do ſo too; allowing little or no difference betwixt Man and Beaſt in this Point; nor does the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver know any other difference between them in this Caſe, ſave that to Mankind there are certain and faithful Promiſes and Predictions made of a future Reſurrection, at the time of our Lord's coming to Judgment; without mentioning the Beaſts, or fore-telling any ſuch matters concerning them. <hi>Page</hi> 95. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>He thinks 'tis eaſie to demonſtrate, That the Souls of Brutes are much more noble than the material Spirits of their Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver is ready to ſay, beſhrew his Heart for being ſo unkind as to forbear or neglect, doing the World and the Obſerver that great Favour which he ſays might ſo eaſily be done, and which the Obſerver would have accepted as a greater Civility, than any which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has hitherto ſhewed him. But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> it ſeems is reſolved to deny him that Courteſie which he thinks he could ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have performed. Then Mr. <hi>M.</hi> proceeds to ſay, <hi>That he is not obliged to incumber his Defence of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality with ſuch needleſs Controverſies.</hi> The Obſerver replys, That if the Queſtion be needleſs, why does he quote or argue it? But if very material and needful (as the Obſerver thinks it to be) why does Mr. <hi>M.</hi> forſake it in this Place, without driving it through to ſome ſuch ſort of Determination, as he was able to make of it? Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays further, <hi>We are ſure that the Humane Soul is much more excellent than the Brutal, becauſe Man can perform more Excellent Things, than the Brutes can do.</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107186:46"/>ſays the fame concerning Mens Bodies, That they have a more excellent Structure, and apter Organs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect than any ſort of Brutes, which together with their extraordinary Inſtruments of Hands and Tongues, make them able to perform Things, that far exceed the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Beaſts: But if ſuch Hands and Tongues were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Humane Body; ſome Beaſts might equal, or exceed, the Race of Men, in making Proviſion for their natural Subſiſtence and Defence, and ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions belonging to each of their Natures. Thus Men are advantaged in the Mode and Structure of their Bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Beaſts; and yet theſe Abilities do not prove, That their Fleſh, Blood, Bones or Breath, do materially differ from thoſe of the Brutes.</p>
            <p>Whence we argue, That though Mens intellectual Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do far exceed thoſe of Brutes; yet that advantage does not convincingly prove, That the Spirits which Act them are of a different kind and nature from thoſe Spirits which act the Brutes; but rather, That the different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in their Head, where ſuch Things are acted, are the true Cauſes of thoſe Excellencies wherein Mankind exceed the Brutes.</p>

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> asks, <hi>Muſt we deny what is plain, becauſe we are not agreed about more remote Difficulties?</hi> The Obſerver An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers No; but deſires Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to make the Soul's Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107186:46"/>plain, and then there will be no Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them about it. He quotes a Saying out of <hi>Tertallian,</hi> forbidding Men to enquire into the Secrets of God. The Obſerver prays Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to apply this to his many Demands and Queſtions concerning the <hi>Quoniodo,</hi> or how Senſe and Reaſon are Acted in Man and Beaſt, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Operation of the Material Spirits in the Heads of either Kind. The Obſerver has ſaid, That <hi>Quoniodo</hi> is a Secret yet reſerved in the Store-Houſe of God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and hitherto unrevealed to the Sons of Men. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>There is yet no ſatisfactory account given of the Senſitive Perception and Appetite, by reducing them to the Laws of Matter and Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſerver requires therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to give ſome Satisfactory account of the Production of Senſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, by the means or intervention of his ſuppoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Spirit, which if he do, this Controverſie will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be determined. <hi>P.</hi> 98. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Animal Spirits and the Brain are principally concerned in the Acts of the Intellect, and therefore the whole</hi> Compoſitum <hi>is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> The Obſerver denyes this Conſequence, and ſays, That the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> is concerned, in Acts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect as well as in thoſe of the Senſes: Prick or Cut the end of the Finger or Toe, the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> inſtantly feels the ſmart, by contiguity of the Spirits and quickneſs of their Communication. So for the Eye, the Ear, the Taſte and the Smell; the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> is inſtantly affected, by their pleaſing, or diſagreeable Objects: So as a quick Smart, a horrid Sight, a piercing Sound, a ſtrong Smell, or a very ill Taſte, breed an inſtant altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and by any of theſe the Operation of the Intellect may be diſturbed or quite put out of order. Whence it appears, That though the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and the Brain are the Principal Agents for acting the Reaſon and Intellect; yet the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107186:47"/>concerned in every moſt ordinary Action of the Perſon; which cannot be performed, or ever was performed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a contexture of Soul and Body, as has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> farther ſays, <hi>You muſt anſwer all that I have written againſt the Capacity of theſe material Corruptible Spirits for the production of ſuch Acts.</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver replies, That he cannot find where Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has ſaid any more againſt the Capacities of ſuch a Contexture, but that he aſſures himſelf and believes, That ſuch a Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot have thoſe Capacities. Whereas the Obſerver conceives, They have ſufficient Capacity to produce and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all Humane Actions, and Powers, according to the Ordination of God, and the Conſtitution which he has appointed in the Creation and Fabrick of a Man. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays further, <hi>That his ſort of Soul does exert ſome Actions, without aſſiſtance of any corporeal Organs, and that it works upon theſe Organs, antecedent to any Operation by them.</hi> His Aſſertion, that it works without them, and works upon them ſeems not at all coherent in it ſelf; for that if it work upon them, and without them, it cannot work by them at the ſame time. But the Obſerver does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deny, That there is any ſuch Soul as he pretends, <hi>viz.</hi> an immaterial intelligent Spirit in the Body of any Perſon naturally: So as he muſt ſuppoſe or beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that there is ſuch a Thing, before he can perſwade any Man, that it does, or works any thing at all. <hi>P.</hi> 99. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> quotes a <hi>Latin</hi> Author who took the Immortality of the Soul for granted, but with thoſe that deny the Immortality, his Aſſertion has no Conſequence or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility at all. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays further, <hi>The muſical Organ is not conſcious of the Harmony produced by it, as the Soul is of its own Acts,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid as the Man is of his own Acts) for if he intend this of his immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intelligent Spirit he knows it to be conſtantly denied by the Obſerver, who affirms, There is no ſuch Spirit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107186:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>in Man; and concerning the material Spirits, has aſſerted, That they have no Knowledge or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what themſelves do. So as it is not the Spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or the Organs alone that can by themſelves do any Thing; any more than the Organ-pipes can make Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony without the Wind, or the Wind of the Bellows without the Pipes; ſound and well ordered, in their proper Places where the Artificer has ranked them.</p>
            <p>Further, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> affirms, <hi>That in the Pamphlet which he intended to Anſwer, the Obſerver had ſaid, That Matter has a Self-moving Power, and gave inſtance in ſome light Earth pulveriſed and made ſo apt for Motion, as that it might become near a kin to the Atoms, which Men way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moving up and down in the Air continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Does not deny the Propenſity which ſuch fine Atoms have to be moved by any gentle touch of Air, or Breath; ſo as falling into a drop of <hi>May</hi>-dew, they will riſe up in the mixture of that moiſture to the very tip of a Graſs-Pile, and be ready to drop from it again; as the weight and activity of the moiſture ſhall carry it. Thus the red Earth of which <hi>Adam</hi> was Created, Pulveriſed by the Art of the great Machiniſt, was made apt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and acted by the inflamed Particles of the Blood, tinded and maintained, by a continual fanning of the Breath: So as this attenuated Duſt acted by the Wind and Fire, was then capable by the Ordinance of God, to act all that he has appointed to be done in or by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men; all which three Ingredients ſtill act in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Perſons, all that really can be done by them.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Concludes, <hi>That except we better underſtood what the Soul is, and how it acts whilſt united to the Body; we ought not to deny its Capacity of acting in a ſeparate Subſiſtence.</hi> The Obſerver thinks he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we had more certain Knowledge, that there is an Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Intelligent Spirit in the Perſon, it is meer loſt labour to trouble our Heads with the Notions of what ſuch a Soul does do, or can do,</hi> in ſtatu concreto, vel ſeparato.</p>

               <hi>P.</hi> 104. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would have us ſtrictly to conſider, <hi>How little Alliance there is betwixt a Thought and any Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thing:</hi> He might as well have bidden us conſider, <hi>How a Horſe that eats and drinks, and evacuates every Day for a Year together, ſhould at the Year's end be ſtill the ſame Horſe.</hi> The Obſerver, bears no inclination to trouble his Head about Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Metaphyſical Notions or Proportions, and therefore refuſes to conſider the Thing propounded, or any of the like Notions. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we have of the Mind,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſomething within us that thinks, Reaſons and Wills; are mighty different, from any Notions we can faſten upon a Body, i. e.</hi> from Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Notions concerning ſuch Things. But the Obſerver thinks, There is no ſuch Thing in the Perſon, as thinks, reaſons wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſays as before with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That it is the Man, who thinks, reaſons, wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> is concerned in ſuch Actions. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays further, <hi>That divers who aſſert the Soul's Immortality, do likewiſe aſſert its Materiality, and that divers of the Fathers were of that Opinion. Pag.</hi> 105. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>It can never be proved, That ſo pure, an Eſſence, as the Soul is, has any natural tendency to Diſſolution:</hi> He, ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to have remembred, That they who deny the Being of ſuch a Soul as he ſuppoſes, will never trouble themſelves about Arguments, whether it be Corporeal and Mortal, or the contrary. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> quotes <hi>Cicero,</hi> who Men have reaſon to believe was of he ſame Opinion with himſelf, and ſerves him inſtead of the Proverb asking a Man's Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 106. he tells us out of <hi>Vives,</hi> That Men are ignorant of the Eſſences of Things, which is granted, and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays thereupon, <hi>That the nature of Matter is not ſo well underſtood, as that the determination of the preſent Controverſie ſhou'd be ſuppoſed to depend upon it.</hi> This the Obſerver is alſo willing to grant, tho' he does not well underſtand what the Effects of it may be in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107186:49"/>He asks further, <hi>Shall we talk confidently, about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality, or Immateriality, and diſpute our ſelves into Atheiſm?</hi> The Obſerver replys, We may talk with a reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence concerning Materiality and Immateriality without diſputing our ſelves into Atheiſm or Sadduciſm; for the Sadducees deny'd the Reſurrection, and future Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after the Death of the Perſon, and ſo do Atheiſts. So as the Obſerver is unjuſty pointed at as one of their Tribes, tho' he maintain the important Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Happineſs of which, and the Dread of it, are to be prepared for, in the time of this Life, by the ſame means that are required for the obtaining the Happineſs of a Bleſſed Immortality, and avoiding the Pains, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of a curſed one. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> endeavours to puzzle his Readers by propounding a hard Queſtion, <hi>Whether Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be diviſible</hi> ad infinitum, <hi>or not?</hi> Which the Obſerver ſays is nothing to the preſent Point in queſtion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaves the choice to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> which ſide of the Queſtion he will maintain in a Diſpute which here makes nothing to the purpoſe. He asks further, <hi>Shall the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul ſtand upon ſo lubricous a foundation, as this is? no ſuch matter.</hi> The Obſerver anſwers, It has not a foundation ſo good as this might prove, nor any firm foundation at all either in Reaſon, or in Scripture, and therefore may be rejected as a vulgar Errour. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to ſhift off the Queſtion upon the Words <hi>material</hi> or <hi>immaterial.</hi> The Obſerver anſwers, He pretends to no ſuch matter, as appears by what he has already ſaid, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Scriptures and Reaſons; the only Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which he pretends to uſe in this Controverſie, and which are uſed more at liberty in his fore-mentioned lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Treatiſe. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>Some great Philoſophers have affirmed, That the Soul is more knowable than the Body:</hi> He ought to have given us their Reaſons, means and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of attaining ſuch Knowledge, or to have produced
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107186:49"/>ſomething of his own to that purpoſe; that the Readers might make ſome judgment concerning the verity of this Aſſertion. And becauſe he has failed in ſo doing, his Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proves very impertinent. He ſays further, <hi>The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Souls differs ſo much from any Corporeal thing, that it may well enough be called immaterial.</hi> This he has Braſs enough to ſay in the Face of a Man who he knows utterly denies, That it has any Subſtance at all. And pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it as an <hi>ens rationis,</hi> whoſe Subſtance and Exiſtence conſiſts in Notion, and Opinion only; and this he does without proving or offering to prove, any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>quod ſit,</hi> or the <hi>quid ſit</hi> of it. The laſt Words of this Chapter may juſtly be put into the Mouth of Mr. <hi>M. qui plus praeſtare poteſt praeſtet.</hi> There is great need of ſome other Mens Labours to ſupply the weak Pretences and performances of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Chapter.</p>

Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Direction in this Page is very good, and deſerves to be well followed by himſelf; who has no other advantage to exempt him from it but the commonneſs of his own Opinion, which is no certain Proof of the Truth of it; for that ſome like miſtakes have long ſince prevailed in the world, to as great an Univerſality. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> further ſays, <hi>'Tis a matter nearly concerns you to know whether your Souls be immortal, or no?</hi> The Obſerver agrees it to be a matter of great concernment for Men to think right in this matter, leſt their Expectations ſhou'd be deceived on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; and therefore he has purſued the Search of it,

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>If after all this pains you have taken to make your ſelf believe the Mortality of the Soul, you find your ſelf miſtaken.</hi> The Obſerver an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, He has taken no pains at all to make himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſo, and yet after the Search he has made he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that moſt probably it is ſo, and has no Fears upon him from it being otherwiſe: For that he makes the ſame Proviſion for a happy Reſurrection, as he wou'd do for a happy Immortality, and puts no difference between them in reſpect of humane Endeavours; believing that which will gain the one, will gain the other, and what will loſe the one, will loſe the other: But he thinks the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to be far better proved, more undoubted and certain than the Immortality is, that therefore the firſt is founded upon a Rock, and the other but upon Sand, or bare Ground at the beſt: And therefore he builds his Faith, and relyance upon the Reſurrection, and believes concerning the Immortality, That it is an Errour, or a Poſſibility ſo uncertain, as no Man reaſonably ſhou'd relye upon it. <hi>P.</hi> 114. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays, <hi>The beſt way to know that he Soul is Immortal, is to keep its Nobleſt Faculties in due Exerciſe.</hi> The Obſerver replys, That he has endeavoured as much as in him lay ſo to do; but found an Effect
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107186:51"/>thereof quite contrary to Mr. M's Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the more he read, labour'd and ponder'd thereupon; the more he has been hitherto confirm'd in the Opinion of the Soul's Mortality; and even the weak Arguments Mr. M. has produced in this Treatiſe of his, for the Proof of the contrary, have added ſome ſtrength to that Opinion, which he had before received, as the Effect of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Endeavours in this kind. <hi>P.</hi> 115. Mr. M. ſays, <hi>We ſhould ſeek Truth for its own ſake, and to be thereby better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for the ſervice of God:</hi> And then he ſays, <hi>We may better expect</hi> Afflatum divini numinis. The Obſerver ſays, He has done the one, and hopes he has received ſome meaſure of the other, ſo as Mr. M's raſh and indiſcreet Cenſures make no Impreſſion at all on him; nor he hopes will do upon any Intelligent Readers of his preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thus anſwered. Further, Mr. M. directs to lay down the moſt plain and certain Truths firſt, and ſo aſcend gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to thoſe that are more difficult; trying thoſe Things that are uncertain, by thoſe that are clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Obſerver may here juſtly reproach Mr. M. for his not obſerving the Rules which he has here laid down; for that in his pretences of proving the Soul's Immortality, he has not produced ſo much as one Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment or Rule, that is clear and certain; which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver thinks he did not omit through negligence, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cou'd find no Experiment, or certain Rule, from whence he cou'd raiſe Arguments, for the proof of his Immortality. Mr. M. ſays further, <hi>There are many puzzling Queſtions concerning his ſort of Soul,</hi> viz. <hi>concerning its</hi> unde, <hi>its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Body, its moving of it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Spirits, its different mode of Operation in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate State and its reunion at the Reſurrection.</hi> The Obſerver replys, That all theſe Queſtions become frivolous to thoſe that accept the Opinion of the Soul's Extinguiſhment at the Death of the Perſon, which fully ſilences them all,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107186:51"/>and proves them needleſs, and ſomewhat ridiculous; and that is the beſt and ſureſt Solution that can be given of them altogether. Mr. M. ſays further, <hi>We muſt not deny the Formation of a Child, becauſe we know not how 'tis made.</hi> The Obſerver agrees this; becauſe Senſation and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, prove there is a Child. Let Mr. M. prove by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Experience, or other Ways, That there is ſuch a Soul in Man, as he pretends to, and then he ſhall have leave to diſpute, <hi>de modo formationis,</hi> as he pleaſes: But to diſpute <hi>de modo</hi> of a Thing which is not granted, or proved to have a Being; muſt paſs for a Diſpute, <hi>de lana caprina,</hi> or as of a Thing not extant in the World. He ſays further, <hi>The Soul it Fettered in the Body.</hi> But this the Obſerver utterly denies, and avers, That the Contexture of the Soul and Body, is naturally and ordinarily the moſt amicable, and pleaſing Conjunction in the World, and their Separation is ordinarily one of the moſt terrible Actions that befalls Mankind, and that it was a moſt groſs Errour in <hi>Plato,</hi> and thoſe that follow him, to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>P.</hi> 117. Mr. M. ſays, <hi>Atheiſm and Sadduciſm ſpring both from the ſame Root, and muſt be attacked together.</hi> The Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwers, That his tacking Atheiſm, and Sadduciſm to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, prove, That they who believe the Reſurrection, are neither the one nor the other; whatſoever Mr. <hi>M.</hi> may fancy. Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Demands concerning the Making and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the World, are very frivolous and needleſs in this Queſtion, or to be demanded of the Obſerver, who has often aſcribed the Creation of Man, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to God, and has acknowledged his Providence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions; ſo as thoſe Queſtions, and thoſe which follow them, are left by the Obſerver, as a Fruit of Mr. M's florid Speaking, but in our preſent Diſpute ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, and of no concernment at all. <hi>P.</hi> 119. Mr. M. ſays, <hi>That</hi> Epicurus <hi>and his Followers, ſaid, That the World was not Created by God, nor Governed by his Providence.</hi> The
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107186:52"/>Obſerver demands, <hi>Quorſum haec? &amp; quorſum ſic?</hi> What makes all this to the Immortality of the Soul? or the Obſerver's Opinion concerning it? It ſhall therefore be paſt as nothing to the purpoſe, nor deſerving any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, nor needing any, as it is produced upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>P.</hi> 121. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> demands, <hi>Dare you take God's Name in vain, or vilifie his Works to his diſhonour? You may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and befool your ſelf for a while; what will you do in the end thereof? How diſmal will the Thoughts of Eternity be to you in the laſt Hour? How ſeverely will Conſcience pay you home for all the Tricks and Abuſes you put upon it?</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver replys, That if a Man ſhould judge Mr. <hi>M.</hi> by thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions it ſeems they might judge him the very Spaun of Satan, whoſe proper Office it is to bring falſe Accuſations againſt the Servants of God, and ſlander them with ſuch Things as they were never guilty of, or intended to be ſo. His Demand, <hi>Dare you take God's name in vain? Or vilifie his Works to his diſhonour?</hi> Seems pregnant with an Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, That the Obſerver dare do ſuch Things. And if it be ſo taken, it is a ſlanderous Surmiſe, and as falſe as any Thing that his Father cou'd ſuggeſt to him. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf was more fine in his Suggeſtions againſt <hi>Job,</hi> which procur'd that Holy Man a ſevere Conflict, and a terrible Tryal. Upon which the Obſerver will make no other return, than that which the Angel made to Satan, in the caſe of <hi>Joſhua, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; the Lord that hath pleaſure in the proſperity of his Servants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy lying lips, and thy deceitful tongue: What reward ſhall be done unto thee, thou falſe tongue? Even mighty and ſharp arrows, with hot burning Coals, who putteſt forth the horns of a Lamb, but ſpeakeſt with the voice of a Dragon. P.</hi> 122. He goes on with divers ſuch Calumnious, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions pointing at the Obſerver, who utterly denies all the Charges laid againſt him in thoſe Pages, and ſays, They are falſe and feigned, and defies his falſe Accuſer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107186:52"/>the Proof of any one of them, which if this vile Railer cannot, or do not produce; the Obſerver hopes he will paſs among his Readers, for a falſe Slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and Condemner of the Innocent. <hi>P.</hi> 123. He talks <hi>of turning our Eyes in upon our Souls.</hi> The Obſerver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him, whether he ever did ſo, and that he will tell the World what evidence of his Soul follow'd upon his ſo doing: It ſeems juſt none at all, or elſe he's very faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in not declaring the ſame to the World. He ſays, <hi>That as the Soul is ſeparated from the Body by Death; ſo in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations we muſt abſtract it from Corporeal Commerce.</hi> The Obſerver ſays, This muſt needs paſs for Gibberiſh and Nonſenſe, with one who denies the Subſiſtence of Souls, in a State of ſeparation from the Bodies. Here he Quotes <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> pretending Men ſhou'd deſire Death, That their Souls might be delivered from the Priſons of their Bodies, and ſome in thoſe times kill'd themſelves, that their Souls might the ſooner obtain their Liberty: And thus this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion became a Doctrine of Devils, and it ſeems the preſent Oppoſer now thinks it cannot well be maintained without the Practice of Devils, <hi>viz.</hi> lying and ſlandering. <hi>P.</hi> 124. He ſays, <hi>Their Bodies are an hinderance to them in ſearching after Truth.</hi> The Obſerver ſays, Souls can make no Searches after Truth at all, nor do any other Thing without their Bodies; nor can he, or any other Man prove, That they ever did ſo, or can do ſo. He ſays; <hi>After Death and not before, the Soul will ſubſiſt without the Body.</hi> Here he denies what ſome of his Partakers affirm, <hi>That the Soul ſometimes wanders from the Body, and after ſome time returns to it again.</hi> But all with a great probability of Falſhood, both in the one caſe, and in the other: It ſeems he matters not how meanly he begs the Queſtion, when he utter'd his laſt Poſition as it were <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> pronouncing that as an undoubted Truth, which he well knows his Opponent fully denies, and how weakly himſelf has, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107186:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>at the poof of it. <hi>P.</hi> 126. He ſays further, <hi>That if men follow the practice of a good Life they will ſoon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that their Souls are Immortal, and not ſuch earthly material Things, as you are ready to imagine.</hi> The Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Replies, That the Evidences of a good Life, are well known to himſelf, and as evident to the World, as any thing Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can produce for himſelf; and yet he does not find himſelf the more perſwaded of the Truth of the Soul's Immortality, nor believes it, ever the whit the more, for the falſe Suppoſitions and Pretenſions, which are made for it by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in this Treatiſe: But rather is confirmed in the contrary Opinion by thoſe deceitful, and falſe Courſes, which the Opponent is driven to uſe, for the ſupport and maintenance of his Opinion. <hi>P.</hi> 127. The Oppoſer ſpeaks <hi>Of Divine Raptures and Anticipations of the Soul's Immortality while they are in this World.</hi> All which the Obſerver thinks to be as well founded as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Air, which are only Products of Phantaſie, and vaniſh with the meer change of the Apprehenſion. The Adverſary ſays further, <hi>That if your Phantaſie be right placed, you will be apt to acknowledge the Natural Image of the Deity, which is antecedent to the Knowledge of God.</hi> The Obſerver Anſwers, That the Image of God in Man, is not in any ſingle Part or Portion of him; but that the whole Man is the only Image of God; for that in the Image of God made he Man, without any more reſpect to his Soul than his Body, which are both together the wonderful Work of God; and ſo great a Wonder to Immortaliſts, as they can by no means believe, That God has Wiſdom and Power enough, to produce Senſe and Underſtanding in the Humane Perſon, by the Energy and Activity of Material Spirits; but that of neceſſity he muſt be driven, to uſe the ſubſervience of an immaterial Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Spirit for thoſe purpoſes: And this ſhall be left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as a very groſs Miſtake and Error of their Minds.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107186:53"/>Our Adverſary ſays further, <hi>That there are a World of Spirits Malignant, and ſuch at ſeek the ruin of mankind, and carry on a Warfare againſt God, and his Intereſt and Religion in the World.</hi> That ſuch Spirits there are, the Obſerver does not deny, and that prompted by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of their own Natures, they carry on a War againſt true Religion, and the Happineſs of Man, he grants; but that they do War againſt the Intereſt of God, or can do it, he confidently denys, and ſays, <hi>That they have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to act or effect any thing, without the Permiſſion, Licenſe, or Direction of that Omnipotent Being, known to us by the Name and Term of God.</hi> The Adverſary ſays, <hi>Thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits know well enough, that the Souls of men are Immortal, Cujus Contrarium,</hi> the Obſerver ſays, <hi>eſt verum,</hi> and ſaith farther, The Evil Spirits take no pains at all to deſtroy the Soul, but the Man, of whoſe contexture the Soul is but Part, and ſuch a Part as extinguiſhes at the Death of the Perſon. <hi>P.</hi> 128. The Adverſary ſays, <hi>you may read from divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors there named, that there are good Spirits which watch over Men, for their guidance and preſervation.</hi> The Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſays, This needs no Proof from his named Authors, for that the Scriptures do teſtifie abundantly for the Truth of it. <hi>P.</hi> 129. The Adverſary diſcourſes concerning Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of dead Perſons, and delivers divers Hiſtorical Relations upon that Subject. The Obſerver does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That divers ſuch like Apparitions may have been, <hi>juſſu, aut permiſſu ſuperiorum,</hi> and that ſuch Apparitions have taken upon them the Image or likeneſs of the dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But he places all that ſort of Apparitions, to the account of inferior ſeparate Spirits, ready to execute what ſhall be appointed them in that kind. What is in this Place quoted out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Obſerver imputes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to meer Invention, or otherwiſe conceives it to have been a lying Relation of one of thoſe Malignant Spirits. What he relates there from <hi>Glanvil,</hi> concerning a Major
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107186:54"/>and a Captain, may better paſs for a Truth; becauſe the tenor of it agrees with what the Obſerver has before ſaid concerning ſuch Things, who always Eſtabliſh'd, That ſuch Apparitions are not acted by the Souls of Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead; but by inferiour ſeparate Spirits, ſubſiſting by themſelves, and which never were united to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men. <hi>P.</hi> 130. The Adverſary ſays, <hi>Men may find nobler things in the World than Matter and Motion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with.</hi> This Aſſertion the Obſerver thinks to ſavour ſtrongly of Ignorance and Falſehood; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he mentions no Particulars of ſuch Things, of which he ought to have given ſome Inſtances, and for want thereof, the Obſerver concludes him true to his Principles of Boldneſs and Ignorance. He quotes here the Names of Authors, as <hi>Plato, Plotinus, Epictetus, Cicero, Senecae, Antoninus,</hi> which it is likely may have drawn him to the Belief of the Soul's Immortality, or confirmed him therein: But their Opinions weigh not much with the Obſerver, who in his Pamphlet upon Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Sermon, propounds to decide this Controverſie by the ſole aſſiſtance of Scripture and Reaſon. The Adverſary pretends to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with Names and Quotations of many Author, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to create an Opinion of his own Reading, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were needful, or uſeful in this Diſputation; a Practice purpoſely avoided by the Obſerver, as being apt more to perplex and lengthen the Argument, than to ſhorten, or come cloſe up to it, and the Particulars of it. The Adverſary ſays, <hi>If you believe that God regards the Affairs and Actions of Mankind, then look unto him for light in this matter, and he that ſo ſeeks after the Truth is in a very likely way to find it.</hi> The Obſerver Replys, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician Cure thy ſelf: If thou had'ſt heartily purſued the courſe here directed, it is very probable, That God might have preſerved thee from uttering and publiſhing ſuch falſe and ſlanderous Calumnies as are inſerted in thy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107186:54"/>levelled and diſcharged againſt an Innocent Perſon, whom thou knoweſt not, not ever haſt heard any Man ſpeak ſo of him; much leſs that thou art able to prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of thoſe Slanders which thou haſt heap'd upon him, and for which he leaves thee to the laſhes of God and thine own Conſcience, and to the judicious and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Cenſure of thy Readers.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">P. </seg>132</label> The Adverſ. ſays, <hi>If I believ'd ſuch Things as the Soul's Immortality I ſhould uſe the greateſt care, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be Holy.</hi> The Obſerver applys this to the certain and firm Doctrine of the Reſurrection; which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do profeſs to believe. He ſays, This Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as great Endeavours and ſtriving by way of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it, as that of the Soul's Immortality can do, and is much better founded, and aſſured than that is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adviſes all Chriſtians to take it more into their Conſiderations than they formerly have done. The new Doctrine of the Immortality has in a great meaſure ſhouldred out that of the Reſurrection: And indeed, if the former were certain and true, there wou'd be little need of the latter among Chriſtians. Perſons after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are likely to live upon the New Earth, and under the New Heaven, which will doubtleſs be a very happy State; but if it be compared to the Heaven of Heavens, and Throne of God, whether they ſay, Good Souls repair at the Death of the Perſon; the Joys of the Earth can come in no Competition with the Joys of Heaven; which thoſe ſeparate Souls muſt then forſake, and come to live
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107186:55"/>upon Earth again in their Bodies, though Glorified; plainly ſuch a Change as thoſe Souls muſt make, at the Reſurrection of the Perſons, is more likely for the worſe, than for the better: Whereas the Doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection intends a compleating of the Happineſs of Man, and bringing it to its higheſt degree, and Perfection; as has always been expected and deſired by the Church as the higheſt Happineſs the Nature of Man is capable of. For Proof of this he quotes <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. our Lord there four times over, ſays, <hi>Thoſe that believe and ſerve him, ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt day.</hi> And at his Departure he tells his Diſciples, <hi>I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo.</hi> Without ſaying any thing of an intermediate State: It runs through all the Goſpels, that at the Reſurrection the Angels ſhall come and ſever the Good from the Bad; preſerving the one ſort, and deſtroying the other. Our Lord in Judgment ſays, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> and <hi>Go ye Curſed into Everlaſting fire.</hi> Not return ye Bleſſed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence ye came; nor return ye Curſed to the Flames of your former Fire. But they are both to go to new Places, where they had not been before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Paul</hi> in both theſe Chapters, Treats profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the future State of Man after Death, and builds the whole ſtrength of future Recompences upon the Doctrine of the Reſurrection only, without mention of, or pointing to any Thing concerning the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.35. Chriſtians then ſuffer'd chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in expectation of a better Reſurrection. He alſo prays that <hi>Oneſephorus</hi> might find mercy in the Laſt Day. And tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>a Crown of Glory was laid up for him againſt that Day.</hi> And ſo for all other true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Believers. And the Obſerver ſaith, That of all the Texts of Scripture quoted for the Immortality, not one of them is delivered in a Place where the future State of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107186:55"/>Man after Death is particularly diſcourſed of, or intended to be taught, except what the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> may have of that Nature. Hence the Obſerver concludes, That the Doctrine of the Reſurrection is the main and Rocky Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, upon which the Expectation of future Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, can ſafely be builded, and therefore he leaves the Immortality to thoſe who think they find better Ground for it, than he hath yet been able to perceive or attain to.</p>

The Adverſ. himſelf ſays, <hi>That the Malevolent Spirits wander in the World, and ſometimes converſe with the People in it.</hi> Which is Evidence, That they are not preſently in Hell. St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> tell us, <hi>That the Devils expect their Puniſhment, after a Condemnation at the Laſt Judgment, which they believe and tremble at.</hi> The <hi>Revelations</hi> expreſs, <hi>That there was War in Heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels fought there, with the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels, but they were vanquiſhed, and caſt out of Heaven.</hi> Which was done but a very ſhort time before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation, or Laſt Judgment. Whence it ſeems reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inferrible, That the Devils are yet not only out of the Verges of Hell; but that they are at ſome Liberty in the World, and make ſometimes their Progreſs unto Heaven. Whence there ſeems no need of a preſent Hell for the Puniſhment of Devils, and for the Separate Souls of Wicked Men: There is as little preſent need of it, for that in Truth there ſeems to be no ſuch Thing in the World, as a Humane Soul ſubſiſting in a State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the Death of the Body. Whence if there ſhould be at preſent ſuch a Place as Hell, it muſt remain utterly unfurniſhed, empty and void, which would not be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way of Proceeding, <hi>Quia natura nihil facit fruſtra.</hi> So as the Diſcourſes, of Separate Souls going to Hell, ſeem rather a Bugbear than a Verity. But to this Men reply, <hi>If there be no fear of Puniſhment before the Reſurrection, bad Men mill grow more bold in their Wickedneſs.</hi> This the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver does not grant, but believes, That they, who will not care for the dread of a curſed Reſurrection, will not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107186:57"/>be perſwaded by the pretence of an immediate Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; a Truth which daily Experience confirms to us. The Diſtance of Time between Death, and the Reſurrection, how great ſo ever the ſame may appear to Living and Senſible Perſons; is not accounted of by the Dead, nor is any Thing dead more Senſible of its paſſing, than the Urn or Stone is, wherein the Dead Man's Aſhes, or Duſt are incloſed: Whence they riſe as but newly fallen aſleep, without any Senſe or Perception of what has paſſed over them. So that Senſibly and Effectually to them, no Time has paſſed over them at all. But their Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection follow one another immediately, without their perceiving that any intermediate Time, has paſſed at all between them: But after the Reſurrection and Laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt, at the Creation of the New Heaven, and Earth, we read, There ſhall be a Hell alſo contrived, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.22, 23. <hi>After God had made the New Heavens, and the New Earth, thoſe raiſed to a Happy State, ſhall go forth and look upon the Carcaſſes of the Men that have tranſgreſſed againſt me: For their Worm ſhall not die, neither ſhall their Fire be quenched.</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.24. <hi>Death and Hell, delivered up the Dead which were in them, and every Man was judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Works; and Death and Hell were caſt into the Lake of Fire; and every one that was not found written in the Book of Life, was caſt into the Lake of Fire. (Viz.)</hi> Such as were Condemned at the Laſt Judgment. At which time God creates a New Heaven, and a New Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sea; but with a Hell, for the Puniſhment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Creatures. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they who ſtand acquitted at that Judgment, for that they may enter in through the Gates into the City, and have right to the Tree of Life: For without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whore-mongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth, and maketh a Lye.</hi> And ſuch as follow the old Satanical Rule, <hi>Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter calumniare &amp; aliquid haerebit.</hi> Among which number

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107186:62"/>to abide among them.</hi> Where, or how, he neither does nor can tell; but he ſtill dreams forward, <hi>That his Soul, and thoſe of whom he has a good Opinion, ſhall be in ſome ſort of Happineſs,</hi> but what ſort of Happineſs himſelf yet is no way reſolv'd; whether in Heaven, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or in the Air, or in <hi>Alcinous's</hi> Garden, the <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſlands,</hi> or the <hi>Elyſium Fields;</hi> or that with the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> they ſhall live dancing and ſinging beyond certain high Mountains; or in <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Paradiſe, ſhall ſit by Rivers of Milk, Honey, Oil and Wine, and fulfil their luſtful Appetites as often as they pleaſe. Take all theſe ſorts of States of Souls, after Death, they are all but Dreams of a ſuitable ſort, and Nature, fit Subjects for Men of Fancy to be employ'd about: And to ſuch Pleaſing Imaginations the Adverſary ſhall be left, whilſt the Obſerver ſets up his Reſt upon what the Scripture teaches plainly, and proves, concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, and laſt final Judgment, and a bleſſed or curſed State after them; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by divers clear Natural Experiments, That the Life of Man is maintained by Blood and Breath, and acted by the inflamed Particles of Blood call'd the Spirits, which muſt daily be renew'd and refreſh'd with Nouriſhment and Reſt; that when theſe are ſpent, the Perſon languiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays; and when they are reſtor'd and refreſh'd the Perſon is vivid and active: If Nouriſhment fail, or the Breath be ſtopp'd, the Perſon dies, beyond all Remedy, and the total Extinguiſhment of that Flame of Life, which is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in the Blood, is the Death of the Perſon, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rekindled in it by leſs than a Divine Power who firſt kindled and tinded it in the Body of our Grand-father <hi>Adam:</hi> And the ſame Death which diſſolves the Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture between the Soul and the Body, deſtroys the Perſons of Men as well as the Contextures of Beaſts, without any other Difference between them, ſave that of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107186:62"/>This is foretold, promis'd and threaten'd to Mankind, and the World of Humane Perſons; without that there are any ſuch Prophecies, Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings deliver'd concerning the Beaſts; and therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> rightly calls them <hi>the Beaſts that periſh utterly.</hi> And as by natural Experience we find that maintains the Life of Man; ſo if we ſearch into the Beginning of his Nature and Compoſition, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> as Men uſe to ſpeak, we may find one Man do's not leſs perfectly beget another, than a Horſe or any other Animal begets Creatures of a like Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with themſelves: There paſſes a Vital Principle in their ſeveral Seeds, which being coagulated <hi>in loco idoneo</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a Fermentation; and being there fomented in their proper Receptacles, they ariſe and grow by degrees to a Vegetation: This Vital Spirit, ſtill operating in the Maſs, now vegetated, it proceeds to the Formation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts and Organs of the Body, extending and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf throughout the whole Maſs, and therein work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till all the Parts and Organs of the Body are fully form'd and perfected. And thence this Vital Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the Production of Senſe in the newly form'd <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon;</hi> which perfected, it brings with it into the World the two fore-named Faculties of Vegetation and Senſe, which remain with the new-born Infant as its only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Powers for ſome time after its Arrival in the World; till that by degrees the Bodily Organs become ſo dilated and ſtrengthened, and the Spirits of the Blood ſo vivid and active, that they produce in the Infant ſome low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Thinking and Knowledge; ſuch as we find in the Brutes, what Diet pleaſes them, and to diſtinguiſh ſuch for their Friends as give them Food, Eaſe and Pleaſure; and to avoid ſuch Things and Perſons as are terrible and ſtrange to them. And thus they live and grow till their Bodily Organs encreaſe and grow in Capacity and Strength, <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:107186:63"/>till the Stomack, Liver, and other ſanguificial Parts, are able more ſtrongly to concoct the Nouriſhment, and to prepare and rectifie the Blood to a higher Degree of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Vigour: And thence the Spirits aſcending to the Brain, and finding there the Organs or Inſtruments ſtill more enlarged and apter to perform the Duties of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculty; they act therein to ſuch Purpoſes as God has there appointed and ordained to be performed. And thus the Vital Spirits and Bodily Organs proceed and grow together, until they both obtain their Perfection of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; ſuch Blood and Spirits acting throughout the whole Body, and in every Parcel and Member of it, thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Activities which the great Artificer intended them for: And by the Continuity and active Motions of thoſe Spirits, ſpread over the whole Body; it comes to paſs, that the leaſt Wound in the end of a Finger or Toe is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately felt over the whole Body; and ſo by Sight, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Smelling or Taſting, the whole Perſon is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceptive and affected therewithal; like the String of an Inſtrument (how long ſoever the ſame may be) if touched to a vibration in any Part of it, the whole String anſwers to that Vibration, and ſounds accordingly: And this ſeems to be the Reaſon of the wonderful Velocity of Senſation and Perception in the Perſons of Men, and therewithal the Brutes may well be conceived to have a great Affinity upon a like Account. This Spirit is not incaged or incarcerated in the Body, but maintains as ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable a Conjunction with it, and with as much Liking and Kindneſs to each other as any known Things in the World can do: And the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed tells us, <hi>That as the Body and Soul are one Man, ſo God and Man are one Chriſt;</hi> whence the Union of the former ſeems as amicable and kind as that of the latter, tho' uſing a joint Contexture, one of them with another; this ſort of Spirit acting in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107186:63"/>and by the Bodily Organs and Members, they together effect in the Perſon all thoſe Motions, Faculties and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which the great Artificer intended and deſigned to be produced in the Humane Perſon, be they thoſe of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Senſation, or Rationality; all which Powers and Faculties they continue to maintain ſo long as their ſaid Contecture has a Conrinuance: Whence the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both Spirit and Members, are all alike affected, one of them with another, and never contrarily or different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of them affected againſt another. It is true, that divers great Variances do often happen between the two different Faculties or Powers of Senſe and Reaſon; which Differences are as durable and laſting as the Life it ſelf: And theſe two Faculties St. <hi>Paul</hi> often calls by the Name of Fleſh and Spirit, which muſt paſs in his Writings for tropical and figurative Expreſſions. Upon which, and divers other Accounts, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>there are ſome Things in St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s Writings which are hard to be underſtood.</hi> Our Experience teaches us, That there are no real Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Bodily Organs and Members, and this ſort of Spirit of which we are now ſpeaking; but that they live and act together, during the Time of their Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the greateſt Amity and Sympathy that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd: They are pleas'd and diſpleas'd, rejoice and mourn together, as two conſtituent Parts of the ſame Perſon; they grow together to a State of Perfection, are ſick and well together, decay and decreaſe in like manner: And where Men live to the uttermoſt Age, their Perceptions, Underſtandings and Memories fail oftentimes before their Taſting and Feeling, which continues with them the whole Extent of their Lives: Then the Perſon conſiſting of ſuch Fleſh and Spirit dies together, the Fleſh and Members turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Duſt, and the Spirit, which is the Flame of Life, extinguiſhing at the Time of that Separation: And at the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107186:64"/>Time of the Reſurrection, the Body ſhall again be raiſed with ſuch a Temperature of the Blood, as ſhall then again be tinded and kindled into ſuch a Flame of Life as the Perſon had enjoy'd in his former State, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. whereby there ſhall ariſe and accrue to the ſame Perſon the ſame Senſation, Perception, Underſtanding, Memory and Conſcience that he had before in the Time of his former Life. So as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> ſeems to be in the right, when Fol. 183. of his ſaid Book he teaches, <hi>That it is the ſame Conſciouſneſs which at the Reſurrection makes the ſame Perſon; ſuch a ſameneſs as St.</hi> Paul <hi>declares by his Similitude of Grains of Corn, as much the ſame as Grains are of the ſame Nature which ſpring one out of another.</hi> Thus united again by the Reſurrection, the Fleſh and Spirit in a like Contexture as they were before, ſhall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the laſt Day before the Tribunal of the Lord Chriſt, and ſhall there receive Judgment, Sentence and Doom according to their Works, and ſhall thence depart to Places of Joy and Happineſs, or to thoſe of Sorrow and Miſery; as by that Sentence and Judgment ſhall be appointed for them. Thus from Experience it ſeems proveable, That there is ſuch a Soul or Spirit in Man, as has been before ſpecify'd: That the ſame conſiſts in the Spirits of the Blood inflam'd and made lucid and glowing: That the Original of this Spirit proceeds from a Vital Principle in the Seed. The viſible <hi>quando</hi> of its Operation appears with the firſt Commencement of Vegetation in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon:</hi> The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> of its Reſidence is every Part and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Body, through which the ſame is contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpread, or rather is one continuate Spirit mixed with the Fleſh throughout the whole Body: As to the <hi>Quo,</hi> and what becomes of this Spirit at the Death of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it has been declared to go out by Extinguiſhment. The only Point which the Obſerver profeſſes Ignorance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107186:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>in, is that of the <hi>Quomodo operatur:</hi> He profeſſes not to know how theſe Spirits of the Blood work in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack a right and healthful Concoction and due Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how in the ſanguifical Parts the Chyle is converted into Blood; how the Breath fans, maintains and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſuch Vigour and Flame to Particles of the Blood which aſcend to the Head; how thoſe Particles of Blood working in the Head and Brain produce there Senſation, Perception, Imagination, Underſtanding, or Memory; how paſſing thence by the Nerves into the reſt of the Body, they cauſe Motion, Activity, Strength and Vigour; all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Will of the Perſon, and ſubjected to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of his Judgment. Thoſe are ſome of the chief Ways of God with Man, and are moſt evident Proofs of his Divine Skill and Power; concerning which, and other-like Divine Operations, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Man cannot find out the Work that is done under the Sun; becauſe, tho' a Man labour to find it out, or the Wiſe among Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to come to the Knowledge of it, yet ſhall they not be able to find it.</hi> In this Ignorance therefore the Obſerver is contended to be a Partaker with the reſt of the World, without herding himſelf amongſt thoſe, who, becauſe they cannot find out the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of this Performance; are eaſily perſwaded to believe, <hi>That God has not Skill or Power enough to perform this; and is therefore driven, and muſt be driven to act thoſe Things in Man by an immaterial intelligent Spirit which they fancy therefore is newly created by God upon every fruitful Coition of Man and Woman, or Man and Beaſt, where the Form of the Product happens to be Humane; and that this new Soul which comes from his Hand innocent and pure, ſhou'd preſently be thruſt by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an impure Body, at the beſt, contaminated by Original Sin, which preſently communicates that Tincture to that pure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but unfortunate miſerable Soul ſo newly created by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107186:65"/>him.</hi> Theſe Abſurdities following upon and flowing from this Error, prove the Opinion from whence they ariſe to be erroneous. And from this, and from all that has been ſpoken before on this Subject; the Obſerver concludes, That the Opinion of Man's being <hi>acted by an immaterial, intelligent Spirit, capable of ſubſiſting in a State of Separation from the Body,</hi> is an Error; and that it is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, That the Perſon of Man is a Contexture of Matter and Spirit both riſing from the ſeminal Agitation, and both mortal; and that the ſound Foundation, for the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Recompences future to this Life, ought to be grounded upon the rocky Foundation of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And herewithal ſhall be finiſh'd the preſent Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon this Treatiſe.</p>
